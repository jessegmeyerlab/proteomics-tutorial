### Proteins

Proteins are large biomolecules or biopolymers made up of amino acids which are linked by peptide bonds. 
They perform various functions in living organisms ranging from having structural roles to functional involvement in cellular signaling and the catalysis of chemical reactions (enzymes). 
Proteins are made up of 20 different amino acids (not counting pyrrolysine and selenocysteine, which only occur in specific organisms) and their sequence is encoded in their corresponding genes.
The human genome encodes more than 20,000 different proteins.
Each protein is present at a different abundances.
Previous studies have shown that the concentration range of proteins can span over a range of at least seven orders of magnitude to up to 20 000 000 copies per cell and that their distribution is tissue-specific[@DOI:10.1038/msb.2011.82][@DOI:10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.036].
Due to genetic variations, as well as alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, multiple different proteoforms can be produced from one single gene[@DOI:10.1038/nmeth.2369].

#### PTMs

After protein biosynthesis, enzymatic and nonenzymatic processes change the protein sequence through proteolysis or chemical modification of the amino acid side chains. 
PTMs are an important biological process contributing to the diversity and control of the cellular proteome. 
Proteins can be post-translationally modified through enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions _in vivo_ and _in vitro_ [@doi:10.1093/database/baab012]. 
PTMs can be reversible or irreversible, and they change protein function in several ways, for example, by altering substrate–enzyme(s) interactions or altering protein-protein interactions [@PMID:33826699; @PMID:24217768]. 

More than 400 PTMs have been discovered in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. 
These modifications are crucial in controlling protein functions and signal transduction pathways [@PMID:23887885]. 
The most commonly studied and biologically relevant post-translational modifications include ubiquitinations (Lys, Cys, Ser, Thr, N-term), succinylations (Lys), methylations (Arg, Lys, His, Glu, Asn, Cys), disulfide bonds (Cys-Cys), methylation (Arg, Lys), oxidations (any amino acid, but especially Met, Trp, His, Cys), phosphorylations (Ser, Thr, Tyr, His), acetylations (Lys, N-term), glycosylations (Arg, Asp, Cys, Ser, Thr, Tyr, Trp) and lipidations.

Post-translational modification of a protein can alter its function, activity, structure, location and interactions. 
PTMs alter signal transduction pathways and gene expression control [@PMID:28656226] regulation of apoptosis [@PMID:23088365; @PMID:11368354] by phosphorylation. 
Ubiquitination regulates protein degradation [@PMID:16738015], SUMOylation regulates chromatin structure, DNA repair, transcription, cell-cycle progression [@PMID:26601932; @PMID:29079793], and palmitoylation regulates maintenance of the structural organization of exosome-like extracellular vesicle membranes by [@PMID:30251702]. 
Glycosylation is a ubiquitous modification that regulates a variety of T cell functions, such as cellular migration, T cell receptor signalling, cell survival, and apoptosis [@PMID:22288421, @PMID:18846099].
Deregulation of PTMs is linked to cellular stress and diseases [@doi:10.1038/s41570-020-00223-8].

Several non-MS methods exist to study PTMs, including in vitro PTM reaction tests with radioactive isotope-labelled substrates, western blot with PTM-specific antibodies, and peptide and protein arrays [@PMID:11062466, @PMID:12323352]. 
While effective, these approaches have many limitations, such as inefficiency and difficulty in producing pan-specific antibodies. 
MS-based proteomics approaches are currently the predominant tool for identifying and quantifying changes in PTMs. 

#### Protein Structure

Almost all proteins (except for intrinsically disordered proteins[@doi:10.1146/annurev-biochem-072711-164947]) fold into 3D structures either by themselves or assisted through chaperones[@doi:10.1007/s12013-021-00970-5]. 
There are four levels relevant to the folding of any protein: 

- Primary structure: 
The protein's linear amino acid sequence, with amino acids connected through peptide bonds.

- Secondary structure: 
The amino acid chain's folding: α-helix, β-sheet or turn.

- Tertiary structure: 
The three-dimensional structure of the protein. 

- Quarternary structure: 
The structure of several protein molecules/subunits in one complex.
