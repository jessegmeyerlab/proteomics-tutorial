Orthogonal validation techniques of discovery proteomic data sets are highly context-dependent. 
- protein abundance changes: SDS-PAGE & immunoblotting etc
- structural proteomics (i.e. LiP-MS): 
-
Altered accessibility of broad-specificity proteases (i.e. proteinase K) to regions of a native protein can be used as a proxy readout for dynamic structural alterations (see LiP-MS).
However, the interpretation of differential cleavage patterns still remains challenging as a range of biological processes can effectively modulate protease accessibility. 
For instance, differential protease cleavage patterns in a native protein can be affected by a change in its interaction with other proteins or metabolites (occluding or exposing protease cleavage sites), conformational changes, and a host of posttranslational modifications (i.e. phosphorylation). 
Therefore, orthogonal approaches are necessary to assess which of these possibilities are at the root of any observed ‘structural change’. 
Multiple methodologies harnessed to further validate and assess structural changes in individual proteins are discussed below.
