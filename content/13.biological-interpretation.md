Orthogonal validation techniques of discovery proteomic data sets are highly context-dependent.
Protein abundance changes measured by bottom-up proteomics are commonly validated on a protein-to-protein basis using techniques such as immunoblotting analysis or immunofluorescence or immunohistological stainings. The latter allow for validation of protein expression in intact tissue or cells. 
However, these semiquantitative methods are commonly strongly influenced by the quality of the antibodies used and might not be sensitive enough to detect small changes in protein levels. 

Other validation methods (single proteins): 
-	MS-based: PRM, SRM
- Non-MS: [...]

Altered accessibility of broad-specificity proteases (i.e. proteinase K) to regions of a native protein can be used as a proxy readout for dynamic structural alterations (see LiP-MS). However, the interpretation of differential cleavage patterns still remains challenging as a range of biological processes can effectively modulate protease accessibility. For instance, differential protease cleavage patterns in a native protein can be affected by a change in its interaction with other proteins or metabolites (occluding or exposing protease cleavage sites), conformational changes, and a host of posttranslational modifications (i.e. phosphorylation). Therefore, orthogonal approaches are necessary to assess which of these possibilities are at the root of any observed ‘structural change’. 

Discussed below are multiple methodologies harnessed to further validate and assess structural changes in individual proteins.

-	NMR
-	Semiquantitative methods (IB with conformation-specific antibodies)
-	In silico molecular dynamics simulations
