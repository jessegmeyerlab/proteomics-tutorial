## Tandem Mass Spectrometry and Peptide Fragmentation {.page_break_before}

### Tandem Mass Spectrometry
Why do we need tandem mass spectra data for proteomics? 
As mass accuracy and resolution increase, the number of potential peptide matches decrease.
Still, there are many potential matches to a human peptide with a 5 ppm mass tolerance window (citation).
Additional information is required to uniquely assign a signal to a peptide. 
Early approaches described use of accurate mass and time data to uniquely identify peptides [@DOI:10.2144/04374RV01]. 
Most current research, however, has pursued using the pattern of peptide fragment masses helps narrow down the number of potential peptides. 

### Peptide Fragmentation

1. Nomenclature of backbone fragments (abc, xyz, internal, losses).
2. Mechanisms of peptide fragmentation, collision based (CID and HCD, PQD?) versus electron based (ECD and ETD).
