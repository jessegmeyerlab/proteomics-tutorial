A schematic representation of various quantitative strategies commonly used in proteomics. A) Label-free quantitation. Proteins are extracted from samples, proteolytically digested into peptides and analyzed by mass spectrometry. B) Metabolic labelling. Metabolic incorporation of stable isotope labelling (“light” or “heavy”) with amino acids strategy takes heavy amino acid metabolic incorporation into mature proteins. The relative peak intensities (MS1) in this strategy represent the abundances of the precursor peptide ions. (C) Isobaric or chemical labelling. Proteins from individual samples are digested into peptides tagged with isobaric stable isotope labelled chemicals. Chemical tags have different unique mass-to-charge (m/z) values that are produced during peptide tandem MS (MS/MS) and used for relative quantitation by relative peak intensity. Peptide fragment ions are used to identify peptides signatures and infer proteins.
