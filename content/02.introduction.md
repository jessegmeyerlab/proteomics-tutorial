## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Proteomics is the large scale study of protein structure and function. 
Proteins are translated from mRNAs that are transcribed from the genome. 
Although the genome encodes potential cellular functions and states, the study of proteins is necessary to truly understand biology. 
Currently, proteomic studies are facilitated by mass spectrometry, although alternative methods are being developed.

Modern proteomics started around the year 1990 with the introduction of soft ionization methods that enabled, for the first time, transfer of large biomolecules into the gas phase without destroying them [@DOI:10.1126/science.2675315; @DOI:10.1002/rcm.1290020802]. 
Shortly afterward, the first computer algorithm for matching peptides to a database was introduced [@PMID:24226387]. 
Another major milestone that allowed identification of over 1000 proteins were actually improvements to chromatography [@DOI:10.1021/ac010617e]. 
As the volume of data exploded, methods for statistical analysis transitioned use from the wild west to modern informatics based on statistical models [@DOI:10.1021/ac0341261] and the false discovery rate [@DOI:https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth1019].

Two strategies of mass spectrometry-based proteomics differ fundamentally by whether proteins are cleaved into peptides before analysis: "top-down" and "bottom-up". 
Bottom-up proteomics (also refered to as shotgun proteomics) is defined by the hydrolysis of proteins into peptide pieces [@DOI:10.1038/nature19949]. 
Therefore, bottom-up proteomics does not actually measure proteins, but must infer their presence [@URL:https://doi.org/10.1021/ac0341261]. 
Sometimes proteins are infered from only one peptide sequence representing a small fraction of the total protein sequence predicted from the genome. 
In contrast, top-down proteomics attempts to measure all proteins intact [@DOI:10.1039/C9MO00154A]. 
The potential benefit of top-down proteomics is the ability to measure proteoforms [@DOI:10.1126/science.aat1884]. 
However, due to analytical challenges, the depth of protein coverage that is achievable by top-down proteomics is less than the depth that is achievable by bottom-up proteomics. 

In this tutorial we focus on the bottom-up proteomics workflow. 
The most common version of this workflow is generally comprised of the following steps. 
First, proteins in a biological sample must be extracted. 
Usually this is done by denaturing and solubilizing the proteins while disrupting DNA and tissue. 
Next, proteins are hydrolyzed into peptides, usually using a protease like trypsin. 
Peptides from proteome hydrolysis must be purified.
Most often this is done with reversed phase chromatography cartridges or tips. 
The peptides are then almost always separated by liquid chromatography before they are ionized and introduced into a mass spectrometer. 
The mass spectrometer then collects precursor and fragment ion data from those peptides. 
The data analysis is usually the rate limiting step.
Peptides must be identified, and proteins are inferred and quantities are assigned. 
Changes in proteins across conditions are determined with statistical tests, and results must be interpreted in the context of the relevant biology.

There are many variations on this workflow. The wide variety of experimental goals that are achievable with proteomics technology leads to a wide variety of potential proteomics workflows. Even choice is important and every choice will affect the results. In this tutorial, we cover all of the required steps in detail to serve as a tutorial for new proteomics practioners.
