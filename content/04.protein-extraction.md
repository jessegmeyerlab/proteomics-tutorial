## Protein Extraction {.page_break_before}

First, proteins must be isolated from the sample matrix. Because some proteins alter other proteins, the goal is to simultaneously solubilizw and denature proteins. This is achieved with a combination of salt and chaotropic agent. 

1. Choice of Lysis buffer
* Urea can cause chemical modifications 
2. Sample type and homogenisation methods
* specialised sample preparation protocols for non-denaturing protein isolation (i.e. for LiP-MS, HDMX-MS etc) 
4. chemicals to avoid: PEGs, detergents etc
5. removal of contaminations, Protein Precipitation
* detergent reomoval resins, S-TRAP (Protifi) etc
7. protein alkylation
* choices of reduction and alkylation reagents, TCEP/DTT/2BME, Chloroacetamide/iodoacetamide, n-ethyl maleimide
