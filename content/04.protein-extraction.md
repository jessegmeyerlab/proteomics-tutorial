## Protein Extraction {.page_break_before}

Proteins must be isolated from the sample matrix to make them amenable for downstream processing. 
Depending on the goal and nature of the experiment, proteins can either be isolated under native or denaturing conditions. 

1. Sample homogenisation methods 

Depending on the type and amount of sample, the experimenter can choose among a well-established roster of homogenisation techniques. 
Mechanical sample disruption is particularly useful for highly resilient samples (i.e. cells with cell walls, tissues such as bone and skin) using a high-pressure homogeniser, an automated freezer mill, or bead beater.
More 'fragile' samples (i.e. mammalian tissue culture cells) can be efficiently homogenised using a detergent-containing buffer (see below), osmotic swelling and subsequent shearing or sonication. 
For a detailed treatment of this subject, we refer to a comprehensive review of homogenisation techniques by Gomes et al. [@DOI: 10.1080/10826068.2020.1728696].  

It is important to consider that a range of constituents present in cell lysis buffers (i.e. detergents) can cause technical problems for downstream mass spectrometry analysis and might necessitate additional steps of removal prior to injection into a mass spectrometer (see section 'Contaminants and their removal'). 

2. Sample homogenisation under denaturing conditions 

Protein denaturation preempts any post-lysis effects resulting from uncontrolled / 'run off' protein activity that could arise from the inevitable disruption of cell compartmentalisation. To efficiently denature proteins, strong ionic detergents (i.e. SDS) and/or chaotropic agents (i.e. urea) are commonly used. 
Heat will also denature proteins but can lead to aggregation, which is resolved by adding a detergents or chaotrope(s). 
Of practical importance, it should be noted that urea-containing solutions should not be subjected to high temperatures due to urea's property to promote carbamoylation of primary amines under these conditions, leading to artefacts [@DOI: 10.1016/j.jchromb.2006.02.022].

3. Sample homogenisation under native conditions

Specialised sample preparation protocols for non-denaturing protein isolation (i.e. for LiP-MS, HDMX-MS etc) often involve gentle methods of cell disruption such as osmotic swelling and shearing through a needle, sonication, incubation in detergent-containing buffer, or repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
