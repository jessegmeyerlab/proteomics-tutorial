## Types of Experiments {.page_break_before}
A wide range of questions are addressable with proteomics technology, which translates to a wide range of variations of proteomics workflows. 
Sometimes identifying what proteins are present is desired, and sometimes the quantities of as many proteins as possible are desired. 
Proteomics experiments can be both qualitative and quantitative. 

### Qualitative experiments
- Identifying proteins 
- Identifying post translational modifications
- Identifying protein isoforms

### Quantitative experiments
- Protein abundance changes
- Phosphoproteomics
- Glycoproteomics
- Structural techniques (XL-MS, HDX-MS, FPOP, protein-painting, LiP-MS, radical footprinting, ion mobility)
- Protein stability and small molecule binding (Thermal proteome profiling, TPP, or cellular thermal shift assay, CETSA)
- Protein-protein interactions (PPIs): AP-MS, APEX, BioID

###Protein abundance changes

### Phosphoproteomics
Phosphoproteomics is the study of the phosphorylation of proteins which can be used to identify proteins, associated proteins, and their post-translational modifications. 
Currently, there are two techniques that are useful for phosphoproteomics: mass spectrometry and western blotting. 
As seen in the figure above, quantitative proteomics over a variety of analytical techniques. 
A key challenge with phosphoproteomics is sensitivity; it is important to ensure that there is sufficient amount of protein before completing a phosphoproteomics project, typically at least 1 mg of total protein per sample. 
- Mass spectrometry
One of the ways to use mass spectrometry to detect phosphorylation is by adding a stable isotope in order to see where phosphorylation would happen that can be seen at the proteome level [@doi:10.1073/pnas.0609836104; @doi:10.1038/msb4100182; @doi:10.4049/jimmunol.176.5.2833; @doi:10.1126/scisignal.2000007].  
It is important to understand what methodology you are planning to use before running the experiments.
Despite advancement in technology of phosphoproteomics, the following challenges still exist: limited sample amounts, highly complex samples, and huge dynamic range [@doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2008.06.006]. 
Current approaches are limited in their ability to detect phosphoproteins at a resolution of 10-15 kD. 
Additionally, phosphoproteomic analysis is often time-consuming and requires the use of expensive equipment such as enrichment kits.

### Glycoproteomics
One PTM gaining interest due to its high occurrence and emerging functional roles is glycosylation. 
Protein glycosylation sites can be glycosylphosphates, N-linked glycosylation sites (asparagine-linked), O-linked glycosylation sites (serine/threonine-linked), or Z-linked glycosylation sites. 
Understanding protein glycosylation will help us understand numerous biological processes since this is a universal protein modification that can be seen across all domains of life [@doi:10.1038/s43586-022-00128-4; @doi:10.1093/glycob/cww086; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2006.08.019; @doi:10.1146/annurev-neuro-071714-034019].


Studies of these two PTMs share several experimental pipelines steps including sample preparation. 
Protein clean-up approaches for glycoproteomics may differ from other proteomics experiments because glycopeptides are more hydrophilic than most peptides. 
Some approaches that have been mentioned in literature include: filter-aided sample preparation (FASP), suspension traps (S-traps), and protein aggregation capture (PAC) [@doi:10.1038/s43586-022-00128-4; @doi:10.1038/nmeth.1322 ; @doi:10.1002/pmic.201300553; @doi:10.1074/mcp.TIR118.001270; @doi:10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00505; @doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.0c04726; @doi:10.26434/chemrxiv.13487364.v1].
Some enzymatic digestion to use include: trypsin, chymotrypsin, tryptophan, tyrosine, GluC, AspN, Pronase, Proteinase K,  OgpA, StcEz, BT4244, AM0627, AM1514, AM0608, Pic, ZmpC, CpaA, IMPa, PNGase F, Endo F, Endo H, and OglyZOR. [@doi:10.1038/s43586-022-00128-4]
- separation of glycopeptides from non-glycosylated peptides
- analysis of glycopeptides using MS strategies
Mass spectrometry has improved over the past decade so that now more strategies that can quantitatively analyze glycosylation sites in proteins. [@doi:10.1038/s43586-022-00128-4] The other use for mass spectrometry for glycoproteomics is structure elucidation.


### Structural techniques
1. XL-MS (Cross-linking mass spectrometry)
XL-MS is an emerging technology for the field of proteomics. It can be used to determine the protein folding and assembly, the dynamics of macromolecules in solution, and the effects of protein modifications on protein function. XL-MS allows molecules to be more stable which then can be ionized and fragmented. XL-MS is different from traditional MS in that it can resolve smaller peptides and proteins; can identify peptides in complex mixtures more accurately; can identify proteins in the presence of other proteins or peptides. [@doi:10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.06.010; @doi:10.1021/jasms.9b00085] 

Following are some suggestive steps as to creating a XL-MS workflow:
1. Determine m/z of ion to be analyzed (generally through collision-induced dissociation), and determine multiplicity of it through measuring the fragment ion energy and some calculation.
2. Cross-link the molecular ion through a cross-linking agent (DSS, BS3, EDC, DMTMM, DSG, BS2G, DSSO, DSBU, CBDPS, PIR). [@doi:10.1021/jasms.9b00085]
3. Determine the cross-linking efficiency through binding energy and calculations.
4. Determine the number is cross-links which then will help you know the molecular weight.

There are still some challenges in XL-MS such as:
1. minimum amount of cross-linked peptides in complex mixtures [@doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04431]
2. diversity of cross linked products [@doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04431]

However, even though these challenges are an issue of now, we can expect further advancement to where this should not be an issue.

2. Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS)
HDX-MS works by detecting changes in the mass of the ion in which the amide hydrogens of the protein backbone is exchanged with its surrounding solvents. [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0459-y]. The rate of exchange depends on the protein folding state, dynamics, and the properties of the amino acid sequence. [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0459-y; @doi:10.1039/C0CS00113A; @doi:10.1016/S0065-3233(08)60129-1; @doi:10.1017/S0033583500005217] Although using D2O as a solvent to make deuterium labeled sample is simple, HDX-MS requires a number of controls to ensure that experimental conditions are done in an unbiased manner. [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0459-y; @doi:10.1586/epr.10.109; @doi:/10.1007/s13361-012-0377-z; @doi:10.4155/bio.15.46] This will produce precise measurements and high reproducibility if done correctly.
[@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0459-y] gives recommendations on how to prep samples, conduct data analysis, and present findings in a detailed stepwise manner that will be useful to have if you are new to using this technique.

3. Fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP ) [@doi:10.1074/jbc.REV119.006218]
Fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP) is a laser based HRPF (hydroxyl radical protein footprinting) MS method that relies on the irreversible labeling of solvent-exposed amino acid side chains by hydroxyl radicals in order to understand structure elucidation of proteins. The laser is set at 248 nm and will cause the hydrogen peroxides to become hydroxyl radicals. [@doi:10.1016/j.jasms.2005.09.008; @doi:10.1016/j.ijms.2006.08.018] The flow rate and laser frequency are adjusted in the flow system so that each protein molecule is radiated only once. After they are radiated, the sample is collected to a tube that has catalase and free methionine in buffer so that the H2O2 and OH can be quench and prevent further unwarranted oxidation. Control samples are made through running the sample through the flow system without any radiation. Another experimental control is done by adding a radical scavenger (glutamine is popularly used) with the purpose of preventing over oxidation. [@doi:10.1002/pro.3408; @doi:10.1021/ac901054w] FPOP has wide application for proteins, to include being able to report fast protein folding and protein transient dynamics.

4. protein-painting [@doi:10.1038/ncomms5413; @doi:10.1016/S0959-440X(02)00283-X]
Protein painting is an optimized MS-based technique in which first the samples are coated with paint molecules. These paint molecules will coat the surfact but will not have access to the protein-protein interface regions that solvents cannot get to. The parts that are painted will not be subjected to trypsin cleavage while the unpainted areas will. After proteolysis, the peptides samples will be subjected to MS. The samples will only show the unmodified opposing regions in the protein-protein interaction at the time of the painting. 

5. LiP-MS (limited proteolysis mass spectrometry) [@doi:10.1016/j.tibs.2020.05.006]
LiP-MS is a two-step process that begins with the separation of proteins of interest using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The separated proteins are then subjected to a liquid-phase micro-sampling (LPMS) procedure, which allows for the analysis of a small number of proteins at a time. This methodology allows for the identification and quantification of the proteins of interest without the need for sample pre-treatment or proteomic analysis.

6. radical footprinting 
This technique uses hydroxyl radical footprinting and MS in order to elucidate protein structures, assembly, and interactions within a large macromolecule [@doi:10.1021/cr0682047; @DOI:10.1021/ac200567u].
In addition to proteomics applications, various approaches to make hydroxide radicals have also been applied for footprinting studies in nucleic acid/ligand interactions [@doi:10.1016/j.cbpa.2005.02.009; @doi:10.1002/0471142700.nc0607s07; @doi:10.1093/nar/gkz089].
Below are known methods of producing radicals for footprinting.

1. Fenton and Fenton‐like Chemistry
2. Electron-Pulse Radiolysis
3. High‐Voltage Electrical Discharge
4. Synchrotron X‐ray Radiolysis of Water
5. Plasma Formation of OH Radicals
6. Photolysis of Hydrogen Peroxide

This chapter is very useful in learning more on this topic. [@doi:10.1002/9781118970195.ch15]


### Protein stability and small molecule binding
1. Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) 
2. cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) [@doi:10.1016/j.cbpa.2019.11.004]
CETSA is a powerful tool for studying protein-protein interactions in live cells. Although CTSA has been widely used to study protein-protein interactions in a proteome-wide manner, little is known about the global changes of protein interaction states with the energy landscape. The assay is capable of detecting shifts in the thermal equilibrium of cellular proteins in response to a variety of environmental perturbations, including the application of voltage, temperature, or magnetic fields. This assay is able to detect both small and large changes in protein interaction states, making it an ideal tool for investigating the effects of environmental stressors on protein interactions.
