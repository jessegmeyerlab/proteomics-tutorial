## Types of Experiments {.page_break_before}
A wide range of questions are addressable with proteomics technology, which translates to a wide range of variations of proteomics workflows. 
Sometimes identifying what proteins are present is desired, and sometimes the quantities of as many proteins as possible are desired. 
Proteomics experiments can be both qualitative and quantitative. 

### Qualitative experiments
- Identifying proteins 
- Identifying post translational modifications
- Identifying protein isoforms

### Quantitative experiments
- Protein abundance changes
- Phosphoproteomics
- Glycoproteomics
- Structural techniques (XL-MS, HDX-MS, FPOP, protein-painting, LiP-MS, radical footprinting, ion mobility)
- Protein stability and small molecule binding (Thermal proteome profiling, TPP, or cellular thermal shift assay, CETSA)
- Protein-protein interactions (PPIs): AP-MS, APEX, BioID


### Phosphoproteomics
Phosphoproteomics is the study of the phosphorylation of proteins which can be used to identify proteins, associated proteins, and their post-translational modifications. Currently, there are three techniques that are useful for phosphoproteomics: mass spectrometry and western blotting. As seen in the figure above, quantitative proteomics over a variety of analytical techniques. Ensure that there is sufficient amount of protein before completing a phosphoproteomics project
- Mass spectrometry
One of the ways to use mass spectrometry to detect phosphorylation is by adding a stable isotope in order to see where phosphorylation would happen that can be seen at the proteome level. [@doi:10.1073/pnas.0609836104; @doi:10.1038/msb4100182; @doi:10.4049/jimmunol.176.5.2833; @doi:10.1126/scisignal.2000007]  It is important to understand what methodology you are planning to use before running the experiments.
Despite advancement in technology of phosphoproteomics, the following challenges still exist: limited sample amounts, highly complex samples, and huge dynamic range [@doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2008.06.006]. Current approaches are limited in their ability to detect phosphoproteins at a resolution of 10-15 kD. Additionally, phosphoproteomic analysis is often time-consuming and requires the use of expensive equipment.

### Glycoproteomics
The goal of glycoproteomics is to understand the interactions between proteins and glycoproteins and to gain insights into the function and regulation of glycoprotein expression. Understanding protein glycosylation will help us understand numerous biological processes since this is a universal protein modification that can be seen across all domains of life [@doi:10.1038/s43586-022-00128-4; @doi:10.1093/glycob/cww086; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2006.08.019; @doi:10.1146/annurev-neuro-071714-034019] The glycosylation sites can be glycosylphosphates, N-linked glycosylation sites (asparagine-linked), O-linked glycosylation sites (serine/threonine-linked), or Z-linked glycosylation sites. 

Experimental pipelines key steps that are shared
- sample selection 
- sample preparation 
Protein clean-up approaches for glycoproteomics may differ in other areas as the solubility may differ. Some approaches that have been mentioned in literature include: filter-aided sample preparation (FASP), suspension traps (S-traps), and protein aggregation capture (PAC) 
If you're interested in looking at some of the approaches that some used, please look at the following citations: [@doi:10.1038/s43586-022-00128-4; @doi:10.1038/nmeth.1322Â ; @doi:10.1002/pmic.201300553; @doi:10.1074/mcp.TIR118.001270; @doi:10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00505; @doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.0c04726; @doi:10.26434/chemrxiv.13487364.v1)]
- enzymatic digestion of samples to enable access to desired glycopeptides
Some enzymatic digestion to use include: trypsin, chymotrypsin, tryptophan, tyrosine, GluC, AspN, Pronase, Proteinase K,  OgpA, StcEz, BT4244, AM0627, AM1514, AM0608, Pic, ZmpC, CpaA, IMPa, PNGase F, Endo F, Endo H, and OglyZOR. [@doi:10.1038/s43586-022-00128-4]
- separation of glycopeptides from non-glycosylated peptides
- analysis of glycopeptides using MS strategies
Mass spectrometry has improved over the past decade so that now more strategies that can quantitatively analyze glycosylation sites in proteins. [@doi:10.1038/s43586-022-00128-4] The other use for mass spectrometry for glycoproteomics is structure elucidation.


### Structural techniques
1. XL-MS (Cross-linking mass spectrometry)
XL-MS is an emerging technology for the field of proteomics. It can be used to determine the protein folding and assembly, the dynamics of macromolecules in solution, and the effects of protein modifications on protein function. XL-MS allows molecules to be more stable which then can be ionized and fragmented. XL-MS is different from traditional MS in that it can resolve smaller peptides and proteins; can identify peptides in complex mixtures more accurately; can identify proteins in the presence of other proteins or peptides. [@doi:10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.06.010; @doi:10.1021/jasms.9b00085] 

Following are some suggestive steps as to creating a XL-MS workflow:
1. Determine m/z of ion to be analyzed (generally through collision-induced dissociation), and determine multiplicity of it through measuring the fragment ion energy and some calculation.
2. Cross-link the molecular ion through a cross-linking agent (DSS, BS3, EDC, DMTMM, DSG, BS2G, DSSO, DSBU, CBDPS, PIR). [@doi:10.1021/jasms.9b00085]
3. Determine the cross-linking efficiency through binding energy and calculations.
4. Determine the number is cross-links which then will help you know the molecular weight.

There are still some challenges in XL-MS such as:
1. minimum amount of cross-linked peptides in complex mixtures [@doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04431]
2. diversity of cross linked products [@doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04431]

However, even though these challenges are an issue of now, we can expect further advancement to where this should not be an issue.

2. HDX-MS 
3. FPOP 
4. protein-painting 
5. LiP-MS (limited proteolysis mass spectrometry) [@doi:10.1016/j.tibs.2020.05.006]
LiP-MS is a two-step process that begins with the separation of proteins of interest using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The separated proteins are then subjected to a liquid-phase micro-sampling (LPMS) procedure, which allows for the analysis of a small number of proteins at a time. This methodology allows for the identification and quantification of the proteins of interest without the need for sample pre-treatment or proteomic analysis.

### Protein stability and small molecule binding
1. Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) 
2. cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) [@doi:10.1016/j.cbpa.2019.11.004]
CETSA is a powerful tool for studying protein-protein interactions in live cells. Although CTSA has been widely used to study protein-protein interactions in a proteome-wide manner, little is known about the global changes of protein interaction states with the energy landscape. The assay is capable of detecting shifts in the thermal equilibrium of cellular proteins in response to a variety of environmental perturbations, including the application of voltage, temperature, or magnetic fields. This assay is able to detect both small and large changes in protein interaction states, making it an ideal tool for investigating the effects of environmental stressors on protein interactions.
