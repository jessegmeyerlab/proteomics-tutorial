## Types of Mass Spectrometers used for Proteomics {.page_break_before}
##Mass spectrometry
Mass spectrometry serves as a sophisticated instrument for determining the masses of compounds and elements, is a science of ions. It can be likened to an ultra-precise scale that can differentiate mass variations down to a single proton or even lower. Since J.J. Thomson's initial exploration in 1912, the field of mass spectrometry has undergone numerous improvements, spanning from isotope assessment to the interpretation of biomacromolecules, all thanks to the combined efforts of diverse fields like chemistry, physics, electronic engineering, and computer science. Nowadays, with the rapid improvement of sensitivity, mass resolution, tandem mass spectrometry methods and dissociation methods, mass spectrometers have evolved as a core tool for proteomics and metabolomic analysis. Additionally, it is precisely the widespread application of mass spectrometry in omics analysis that has given rise to more instrument manufacturers and a greater diversity of mass spectrometer types. This also brings a happy annoyance to many beginners or researchers in other fields who have no background in mass spectrometry: which manufacturer and which type of mass spectrometry should I choose to analyze my project? Here, to help new learners build a basic understanding faster, we will briefly introduce some basic concepts, common types of mass spectrometry, and their suitable application scenarios.
