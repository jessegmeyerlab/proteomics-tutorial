## Types of Mass Spectrometers used for Proteomics {.page_break_before}

1. QQQ
2. Q-TOF
3.  Q-TOF is an unique analyzer that was originally developed in the early 1980s that combines both the usage of a quadropole (Q) technology and time of flight (TOF) analyzer that allows researcher to attain high resolution.  As of current, Q-TOF is widely used in numerous fields and have been proved useful in proteomics.

  The first mode (Q1) utilizes the first in a mode that is radio frequency only to ensure that there is an accurate mass of the unfragmented precursor ion.  This first mode is also known as the single MS mode and methods can be manipulated with the Q-TOF in order to just analyze the unfragmented ion [@pubmed: PMC6719743/] The second mode (often referred to as MS/MS) allows the utilization of both quadropole and time-of-flight (TOF) analyzer to allow for a more accurate read.  The Q1 in this instance will act as a filter only alllowing mass ranges to go through.  In the second quadropole (Q2), which acts like a collision cell in this instance, ions are bombarded by neutral gas molecules which results in fragmentation of the ions by a process known as collision induced dissociation [@pubmed: PMC6719743/].   Fragmented ions and precursor ions are then charged with the same kinetic energy and sent to the TOF analyzer to get accurate mass measurements.
