### Mass spectrometry
Mass spectrometry serves as a sophisticated instrument for determining the masses of compounds and elements, is a science of ions. It can be likened to an ultra-precise scale that can differentiate mass variations down to a single proton or even lower. Since J.J. Thomson's initial exploration in 1912, the field of mass spectrometry has undergone numerous improvements, spanning from isotope assessment to the interpretation of biomacromolecules[@DOI:10.1021/ac8013065], all thanks to the combined efforts of diverse fields like chemistry, physics, electronic engineering, and computer science. Nowadays, with the rapid improvement of sensitivity, mass resolution, tandem mass spectrometry methods and dissociation methods, mass spectrometers have evolved as a core tool for proteomics and metabolomic analysis. Additionally, it is precisely the widespread application of mass spectrometry in omics analysis that has given rise to more instrument manufacturers and a greater diversity of mass spectrometer types. This also brings a happy annoyance to many beginners or researchers in other fields who have no background in mass spectrometry: which manufacturer and which type of mass spectrometry should I choose to analyze my project? Here, to help new learners build a basic understanding faster, we will briefly introduce some basic concepts, common types of mass spectrometers, and their suitable application scenarios. 
### Structure and principles   
The fundamental principle of mass spectrometry revolves around specific physical processes and mathematical formulas. Since this article serves as a guide for those new to the field, particularly those from a biology background, we've chosen to steer clear of delving too deeply into intricate mathematical and physical explanations. However, for those keen on a deeper understanding, we've included references pertaining to these foundational principles. In this piece, our focus lies on introducing fundamental concepts and outlining the typical workflow in mass spectrometry.
The process of mass spectrometry (MS) is to generate gas phase ions from compounds in samples by any suitable method, to separate these ions by their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and then detect them by their respective m/z and abundance. The successful implementation and demonstration of this process requires participation of five fundamental systems (Figure 10.1):
1)	The ion source, where gas phase ions are generated. Common methods of ionization in mass spectrometry includes electrospray ionization (ESI), matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), electron ionization (EI) and chemical ionization (CI) [@DOI:10.1016/j.aca.2015.07.012; @DOI:10.1080/05704928.2014.954046].  For proteomic analysis, soft ionization methods such as ESI and MALDI are the most widely applied techniques[@DOI:10.1126/science.2675315;@DOI:10.1002/rcm.1290020802], which will be discussed in next chapter and no more redundance here.
2)	The mass analyzer, where gas phase ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) based on physic principles. There are several types of mass analyzers applied in mass spectrometry, such as time-of-flight (TOF), quadrupole, ion trap, orbitrap, Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR), and magnetic sector analyzers[@DOI:10.3389/fchem.2021.813359; @DOI:10.1146/annurev-anchem-071114-040325 ], each with unique advantages and applications (Table 10.1). For proteomic analysis, tandem mass spectrometry, which involves combining two or three different mass analyzers, is typically used to achieve precursor selection, structural analysis, improved sensitivity, and better mass resolution[@DOI:10.1016/j.jasms.2007.11.013]. Mass analyzer is the core component of a mass spectrometer, it is also the most important factor that we need to take into consideration when choosing a mass spectrometer for our project.
3)	The detector, where separated ions are detected and their respective m/z values and abundances are recorded, generating a mass spectrum. Common types of ion detectors, including the Electron Multiplier (EM), Photomultiplier Tube (PMT), Microchannel Plate (MP) and Faraday Cup (FC) [@DOI:10.11648/j.cbe.20180304.11], along with their strengths and limitations, are illustrated in Table 10.2. It is worth noting that Orbitrap and FT-ICR mass analyzers don't use conventional detectors as listed above. Instead, they detect ions in a fundamentally different way by detecting image current produced by oscillating ions [@DOI:10.1002/9780470027318.a9309.pub2; @DOI:pub2;10.1021/ac4001223; @DOI:10.1016/B978-0-12-814013-0.00005-3]. In both mass analyzers, the detector is essentially measuring an electrical current (or more accurately, a voltage that's proportional to the current) that's induced by the motion of the ions. This signal is then processed to extract the frequencies of oscillation and fourier-transformed into a mass spectrum. This is quite different from other types of detectors that count individual ions or particles striking a surface. 
4)	The vacuum system, which is designed to maintain a vacuum environment for ions’ movement inside the instrument, are consist of different kinds of pumps including rough vacuum pumps (rotary vane pumps, scroll pumps) and high vacuum pumps (turbo molecular pumps, diffusion pumps). The reason for maintaining a high vacuum is to reduce the collision between ions and gas molecules during their travel, which can affect their trajectory and patterns. FT-ICR and Orbitrap usually require higher vacuum in the 10-9 to 10-11 Torr range, while TOF requires medium vacuum in the 10-7  to 10-8 Torr range, and Quadrupole and Ion trap require lower vacuum in the 10-5  to 10-6 Torr range. 
5)	The control system, which primary role is to regulate and coordinate the various parts of the mass spectrometer to ensure seamless functioning. This typically includes ion source control, mass analyzer control, detector control, data acquisition control, interfacing with auxiliary systems (such as a liquid chromatograph and gas chromatograph), and modules for instrument diagnostics and calibration.
### Types of mass spectrometers used for proteomics. 
Typically, mass spectrometers are named based on the abbreviations of their principal or tandem mass analyzers. This naming convention stems from the fact that the mass analyzer forms the core component of a mass spectrometer, and it also dictates key performance attributes such as mass resolution, scanning speed, sensitivity, and cycle time. These performance metrics, in turn, determine what type of analysis we can conduct, its speed and its accuracy.

### 1. Triple quadrupole 
Triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (often abbreviated as QqQ, TQ, or TQMS), as suggested by the name, is a type of tandem mass spectrometer that three quadrupole mass analyzers are combined in series (Figure 10.2). Each quadrupole is essentially a set of four parallel metal rods to which radio frequency (RF) and direct current (DC) voltages are applied to each opposing pair of rods. The QqQ operate in a synchronized manner to isolate ions of interest (according to the Matthew equation), induce fragmentation, and then detect the resulting fragment ions. Specifically, first quadrupole (Q1) is a mass filter, where ions of a specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) are selected from the incoming ion beam. This is achieved by adjusting the voltage applied to the pair rods within the quadrupole, allowing ions with a particular m/z value to pass through while deflecting others. Second quadrupole (Q2), also known as the collision cell, is where selected ions from Q1 are fragmented into product ions. This fragmentation happens due to the collisions between inert gas molecules (nitrogen, argon, or helium) and ions, which causes the ions to break up (fragment) into smaller pieces (fragment ions). This process is known as collision-induced dissociation (CID). The Q2 is usually only subjected to RF potential and does not filter ions; instead, it transmits the product ions to the third quadrupole. In some tandem mass spectrometry, hexapole or octupole are also using to replace quadrupole as the collision cell. Lastly, the third quadrupole (Q3) acts as a secondary mass filter, similar to Q1, but with the purpose of selecting specific fragment ions produced in the collision cell while excluding other ions. The chosen ions are then directed to the detector, where their abundance is measured (Figure 10.2). This process, involving precursor ions selection, precursor ions fragmentation, and product ions detection, is a general operating principle in tandem mass spectrometry and determines what kind of scan mode you can utilize.
A key characteristic and advantage of QqQ is the flexibility of choosing various scan modes, including: 

(1) Product Ion Scan: Q1 is set to filter a specific precursor ion, which is then fragmented in Q2. Q3 scans the full range of product ion masses. This mode is usually used to identify the structure of a particular compound. 
(2) Precursor Ion Scan: Q3 is set to filter a specific product ion. Q1 scans the full range of precursor ions that, when fragmented in Q2, yield the selected product ion. This mode is used to find compounds that yield a specific fragment ion, which can be particularly useful when looking for compounds with a common structural motif. 
(3) Neutral Loss Scan: Both Q1 and Q3 scan the full range of ions, but with a mass difference equal to a specific "neutral loss". This mode is used to identify compounds that, when fragmented, lose a specific neutral molecule. 
(4) Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM): Both Q1 and Q3 are set to filter specific ions (precursor and product, respectively). This highly selective mode is used for quantitative analysis of specific compounds, offering excellent sensitivity and specificity.

The triple quadrupole mass spectrometer is a highly versatile instrument, capable of both qualitative and quantitative analysis. It is particularly well-suited for targeted quantitative analysis due to its high sensitivity, selectivity, and dynamic range, which has made it a go-to instrument in areas such as drug metabolism studies, environmental monitoring, food safety analysis, pharmaceuticals, and clinical diagnostics.  However, Quadrupole suffer from inherent limitations in mass resolution due to the constraints of principles and precision in mechanical manufacturing. Consequently, they face difficulties in accurately identifying unknown molecules within complex mixtures and thus not appropriate for applications like structure analysis and biomarker discovery. 

### 2. Q-TOF
Even though quadrupoles face difficulties in accurately identifying unknown peptides within complex mixtures, they serve effectively as mass filters, making them an excellent choice for combining with other high-resolution mass analyzers to form tandem mass spectrometry systems. One commonly used approach is Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (Q-TOF-MS), a 'hybrid' device, integrating quadrupole techniques with a time-of-flight mass analyzer.
W.E. Stephens constructed and published the design of the first time-of-flight (TOF) analyzer in 1946. The TOF principle is quite straightforward: ions of different mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) are imparted with the same initial kinetic energy (E = ½ mv2) and then separated over time as they travel along a field-free drift path of known length. If all ions begin their flight simultaneously, or at least within a short enough time span, the lighter ions will reach the detector before the heavier ones due to their faster velocity (V). Based on this principle, the m/z of different ions can be calculated according to the order in which they reach the detector. Similarly, we can easily conclude that the longer of the drift path, the higher of the mass resolution can reach if keep the response time of detector the same. In fact, in pursuit of higher mass resolution, researchers have indeed built time-of-flight (TOF) drift tubes that are tens of meters long. However, apparently, this is not practical for widely application in a regular lab place. An alternative way to achieve higher resolution is to apply reflector (often called a reflectron) for TOF. The principles and advantages of using a reflector can be summarized as follows: 
1) Under ideal circumstances within a TOF mass spectrometer, ions sharing the same m/z would reach the detector concurrently post-acceleration, thus generating a sharp peak on the mass spectrum. However, the inherent oscillation path variability of ions within the mass spectrometer makes it challenging to maintain uniform initial kinetic energy amongst all ions, leading to peak broadening and a substantial reduction in mass resolution. The reflector is designed to rectify this issue. Comprising a series of electrodes that set to different voltages, the reflector generates a retarding electric field that reverses ion trajectories back through the flight tube. Notably, the reflector is engineered such that ions carrying lower kinetic energy delve less into the reflector and have a reduced flight path, while those with higher kinetic energy permeate more deeply and follow a longer flight path. This equalizes the variances in initial kinetic energy, enabling ions of the same m/z to hit the detector almost simultaneously, thereby enhancing the resolution of TOF.
2) Furthermore, the usage of reflector effectively expands the flight path length within the same physical confines, resulting in superior ion separation and consequently, higher resolution. As such, reflecting TOF forms the basis of most commercial instruments currently in use.

The construction of a Q-TOF bears significant resemblance to a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer, with the critical distinction that the third quadrupole has been replaced by a time-of-flight tube. Figure 9.3 delineates the schematic of a typical Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer, which comprises three fundamental components: 
1) Quadrupole mass analyzer (Q): This part of the instrument is basically the same to the Q1 in QqQ, which select specific m/z values to pass through by applying a combination of DC and RF voltages across the rods.
2) Collision cell: Here, selected ions undergo collision-induced dissociation (CID) by interacting with a neutral gas, leading to their fragmentation into smaller constituents. This process yields structural information about the original molecules. Usually, quadrupole, hexapole, or even octopole are used as the collision cell for better focusing and transporting.
3) Time-of-Flight (TOF) mass analyzer: Upon exiting the collision cell, the fragmented ions are reaccelerated into the ion modulator region of the time-of-flight analyzer. There, they undergo pulsing by a strong electric field (typically 20 kV or higher) and get accelerated to a field free drift tube, and then reflected to the detector.
TOF generally offers mass resolutions surpassing 50,000, rendering it a reliable instrument for identifying unknown compounds. Moreover, the rapid travel time of ions in the vacuum tube (at the nanosecond level) confers Q-TOF with distinctive benefits in high-throughput and short gradient analyses. Presently, Q-TOF related instruments are available from all leading instrument manufacturers, and the main models are listed below:
