## Types of Mass Spectrometers used for Proteomics {.page_break_before}
### Mass spectrometry
Mass spectrometry serves as a sophisticated instrument for determining the masses of compounds and elements, is a science of ions. It can be likened to an ultra-precise scale that can differentiate mass variations down to a single proton or even lower. Since J.J. Thomson's initial exploration in 1912, the field of mass spectrometry has undergone numerous improvements, spanning from isotope assessment to the interpretation of biomacromolecules[@DOI:10.1021/ac8013065], all thanks to the combined efforts of diverse fields like chemistry, physics, electronic engineering, and computer science. Nowadays, with the rapid improvement of sensitivity, mass resolution, tandem mass spectrometry methods and dissociation methods, mass spectrometers have evolved as a core tool for proteomics and metabolomic analysis. Additionally, it is precisely the widespread application of mass spectrometry in omics analysis that has given rise to more instrument manufacturers and a greater diversity of mass spectrometer types. This also brings a happy annoyance to many beginners or researchers in other fields who have no background in mass spectrometry: which manufacturer and which type of mass spectrometry should I choose to analyze my project? Here, to help new learners build a basic understanding faster, we will briefly introduce some basic concepts, common types of mass spectrometers, and their suitable application scenarios. 
### Structure and principles   
The fundamental principle of mass spectrometry revolves around specific physical processes and mathematical formulas. Since this article serves as a guide for those new to the field, particularly those from a biology background, we've chosen to steer clear of delving too deeply into intricate mathematical and physical explanations. However, for those keen on a deeper understanding, we've included references pertaining to these foundational principles. In this piece, our focus lies on introducing fundamental concepts and outlining the typical workflow in mass spectrometry.
The process of mass spectrometry (MS) is to generate gas phase ions from compounds in samples by any suitable method, to separate these ions by their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and then detect them by their respective m/z and abundance. The successful implementation and demonstration of this process requires participation of five fundamental systems (Figure 1.1):
1)	The ion source, where gas phase ions are generated. Common methods of ionization in mass spectrometry includes electrospray ionization (ESI), matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), electron ionization (EI) and chemical ionization (CI) [@DOI:10.1016/j.aca.2015.07.012; @DOI:10.1080/05704928.2014.954046].  For proteomic analysis, soft ionization methods such as ESI and MALDI are the most widely applied techniques[@DOI:10.1126/science.2675315;@DOI:10.1002/rcm.1290020802], which will be discussed in next chapter and no more redundance here.
2)	The mass analyzer, where gas phase ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) based on physic principles. There are several types of mass analyzers applied in mass spectrometry, such as time-of-flight (TOF), quadrupole, ion trap, orbitrap, Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR), and magnetic sector analyzers[@DOI:10.3389/fchem.2021.813359; @DOI:10.1146/annurev-anchem-071114-040325 ], each with unique advantages and applications (Table 10.1). For proteomic analysis, tandem mass spectrometry, which involves combining two or three different mass analyzers, is typically used to achieve precursor selection, structural analysis, improved sensitivity, and better mass resolution[@DOI:10.1016/j.jasms.2007.11.013]. Mass analyzer is the core component of a mass spectrometer, it is also the most important factor that we need to take into consideration when choosing a mass spectrometer for our project.
3)	The detector, where separated ions are detected and their respective m/z values and abundances are recorded, generating a mass spectrum. Common types of ion detectors, including the Electron Multiplier (EM), Photomultiplier Tube (PMT), Microchannel Plate (MP) and Faraday Cup (FC) [@DOI:10.11648/j.cbe.20180304.11], along with their strengths and limitations, are illustrated in Table 10.2. It is worth noting that Orbitrap and FT-ICR mass analyzers don't use conventional detectors as listed above. Instead, they detect ions in a fundamentally different way by detecting image current produced by oscillating ions [@DOI:10.1002/9780470027318.a9309.pub2; @DOI:pub2;10.1021/ac4001223; @DOI:10.1016/B978-0-12-814013-0.00005-3]. In both mass analyzers, the detector is essentially measuring an electrical current (or more accurately, a voltage that's proportional to the current) that's induced by the motion of the ions. This signal is then processed to extract the frequencies of oscillation and fourier-transformed into a mass spectrum. This is quite different from other types of detectors that count individual ions or particles striking a surface. 
4)	The vacuum system, which is designed to maintain a vacuum environment for ionsâ€™ movement inside the instrument, are consist of different kinds of pumps including rough vacuum pumps (rotary vane pumps, scroll pumps) and high vacuum pumps (turbo molecular pumps, diffusion pumps). The reason for maintaining a high vacuum is to reduce the collision between ions and gas molecules during their travel, which can affect their trajectory and patterns. FT-ICR and Orbitrap usually require higher vacuum in the 10-9 to 10-11 Torr range, while TOF requires medium vacuum in the 10-7  to 10-8 Torr range, and Quadrupole and Ion trap require lower vacuum in the 10-5  to 10-6 Torr range. 
5)	The control system, which primary role is to regulate and coordinate the various parts of the mass spectrometer to ensure seamless functioning. This typically includes ion source control, mass analyzer control, detector control, data acquisition control, interfacing with auxiliary systems (such as a liquid chromatograph and gas chromatograph), and modules for instrument diagnostics and calibration.
