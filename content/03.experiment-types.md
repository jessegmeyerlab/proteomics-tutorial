## Types of Experiments {.page_break_before}
A wide range of questions are addressable with proteomics technology, which translates to a wide range of variations of proteomics workflows. 
Sometimes identifying what proteins are present is desired, and sometimes the quantities of as many proteins as possible are desired. 
Proteomics experiments can be both qualitative and quantitative. 

### Qualitative experiments
- Identifying proteins 
- Identifying post translational modifications
- Identifying protein isoforms

### Quantitative experiments
- Protein abundance changes
- Phosphoproteomics
- Glycoproteomics
- Structural techniques (XL-MS, HDX-MS, FPOP, protein-painting, LiP-MS, radical footprinting, ion mobility)
- Protein stability and small molecule binding (Thermal proteome profiling, TPP, or cellular thermal shift assay, CETSA)
- Protein-protein interactions (PPIs): AP-MS, APEX, BioID
