## Analysis of Raw Data {.page_break_before}

The goal of basic data analysis is to convert raw spectral data into identities and quantities of peptides and proteins that can be used for biologically-focused analysis. 
This step may often include measures of quality control, cross-run data normalization, quantification on different levels (precursor, peptide, protein), protein inference, PTM (post translational modification) localization and also first steps of data analysis, such as statistical hypothesis tests. 

In typical bottom-up proteomics experiments, proteins are digested into peptides and further analyzed with LC-MS/MS systems. 
Peptides can have different PTMs and ionize differently depending on their length and amino acid distributions. 
Therefore, mass spectrometers often record different charge and modification states of one single peptide. 
The entity that is recorded on a mass spectrometer is usually referred to as a precursor ion (peptide with its modification and charge state). 
This precursor ion is fragmented and the precursor or peptide sequences are obtained though spectral matching. 
The quantity of a precursor is estimated with various methods.
The measured precursor quantities are combined to generate a peptide quantity. 
Peptides are also often combined into a protein group through protein inference, which combines multiple peptide identifications into a single protein identification [@DOI:https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.R500012-MCP200] [@DOI:10.1016/j.jprot.2016.08.002].
Protein inference is still a challenge in bottom-up proteomics. 

Due to the inherent differences in the data structures of DDA and DIA measurements, there exist different types of software that can facilitate the steps mentioned above. 
The existing software for DDA and DIA analysis can be further divided into freeware and non-freeware:

### Analysis of DDA data
DDA data analysis can be performed in one of the two ways- either with the vendor propreitary format directly analyzed using a propreitary search engine like Mascot, Sequest (through Proteome Discoverer), Paragon (through Protein Pilot), or it can be processed through one of the many freely available search engines or pipelines, for example - MaxQuant, MSGF+, X!Tandem, Morpheus, MSFragger, OMSSA, or Trans-Proteomics pipeline (TPP).
The raw data is converted to either text-based MGF (mascot generic format) or into stadard open XML implementation like mzML format.
The appropriate FASTA file is chosen as a reference database to search the experimental spectra.
All search prarameters like peptide and fragment mass errors (i.e. MS1 and MS2 tolerances), enzyme specificity, number of missed cleavages, chemical artefacts (fixed modifications) and potential biological modifications (variable/dynamic modifications) are specified before executing the search.
The search algorithm fetches the best possible match for each query spectrum, from among a list of scored candidate peptides for that query spectrum. Each spectrum and its corresponding scored candidate peptide is called a peptide spectrum match (PSM).
The scores reflect a _goodness-of-fit_ between an experimental spectrum and a theoretical one and do not necessarily depict the correctness of the peptide assignment.

For evaluating the matches, a decoy database is preferred as a null model for peptide matching.
A randomized or reversed version of target database is used as a nonparametric null model.
The decoy database can be searched separate from the target database (Kall's method)[@DOI:10.1021/pr700600n] or it can be combined with the target database before search (Elias and Gygi method)[@DOI:10.1038/nmeth1019].
Using either separate method or concatenated database search method, an estimate of false hits can be calculated which is used to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) [@DOI:10.1007/978-1-4939-3106-4_7]. 
The FDR denotes the proportion of false hits in the population accepted as true.
For Kall's method: the false hits are estimated to be the number of decoys above a given threshold. It is assumed that the number of decoy hits that pass a threshold are the false hits. A similar number of target population may also be false. Therefore, the FDR is calculated as-
\begin{equation}FDR = #Decoy PSMs/#Target PSMs\end{equation}

For Elias and Gygi Method, the target population in which FDR is estimated changes.
The target and decoy hits coming from a joint database compete against each other.
For any spectrum, either a target or a decoy peptide can be the best hit.
It is argued that the joint target-decoy population has decoy hits as confirmed false hits.
However, due to the joint database search, the target database may also have equal number of false hits. Thus, the number of false hits is doubled during FDR estimation.
\begin{equation}FDR = (2 * # Decoy PSMs)/ (#(Target+Decoy) PSMs)\end{equation}
