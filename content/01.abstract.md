## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Proteomics is the large scale study of protein structure and function from biological systems through protein identification and quantification.  
"Shotgun proteomics" or "bottom-up proteomics" is the prevailing strategy, in which proteins are hydrolyzed into peptides that are analyzed by mass spectrometry.
Proteomics studies can be applied to diverse studies ranging from simple protein identification to studies of proteoforms, protein-protein interactions, protein structural alterations, absolute and relative protein quantification, post-translational modifications, and protein stability. 
To enable this range of different experiments, there are diverse strategies for proteome analysis. 
The nuances of how proteomic workflows differ may be difficult to understand for new practitioners. 
Here, we provide a comprehensive tutorial of different proteomics methods. 
Our tutorial covers all necessary steps starting from protein extraction and ending with biological interpretation. 
We expect that this work will serve as a basic resource for new practitioners of the field of shotgun or bottom-up proteomics.
