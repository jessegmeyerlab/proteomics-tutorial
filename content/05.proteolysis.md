## Proteolysis {.page_break_before}

Proteolysis is the defining step that differentiates bottom-up or shotgun proteomics from top-down proteomics. 
Hydrolysis of proteins is extremely important because it defines the population of potentially identifyable peptides. 
Generally peptides between a length of 7-35 amino acids are considered useful for mass spectrometry analysis.
Peptides that are too long are difficult to identify by tandem mass spectrometry, or may be lost during sample preparation due to peptides that are too short are less likely to uniquely match to a single protein. 
There are many choices of enzymes and chemicals that hydrolyze proteins into peptides. 
This section summarizes potential choices and their strengths and weaknesses. 

Trypsin is the most common choice of protease for proteome hydrolysis [@DOI:10.1002/mas.21376].
Trypsin is favorable because of its specificity, availability, efficiency and low cost. 
Trypsin cleaves at the C-terminus of basic amino acids, Arg and Lys. 
Many of the peptides generated from trypsin are short in length (less than ~ 20 amino acids), which is ideal for chromatographic separation, MS-based peptide fragmentation and identification by database search.
The main drawback of trypsin is that majority (56%) of the tryptic peptides are ≤ 6 amino acids, and hence using trypsin alone limits the observable proteome [@PMID:20113005; @PMID:25823410; @PMID:30687733].
This limits the number of identifiable protein isoforms and post-translational modifications.

4. Challenges associated with alternative enzyme choices (non-specific and semi-specific enzymes)

Many alternative proteases are available with different specificities that complement trypsin to reveal different proteomic sequences [@PMID:12643544; @PMID:20113005], which can help distinguish protein isoforms [@PMID:27123950].
The enzyme choice mostly depends on the application.
In general, for a mere protein identification mostly trypsin is the choice due to the reasons aforementioned.
However, alternative enzymes can facilitate _de novo_ assembly when the genomic data information is limited in the public database repositories [@pmid:31615963; @pmid:30622160; @pmid:29990557; @doi:10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.106324; @DOI:10.1021/pr400173d].
Use of multiple proteases for proteome digestion also can improve the sensitivity and accuracy of protein quantification [@PMID:30336047].

Lysyl endopeptidase (Lys-C) obtained from  _Lysobacter enzymogenesis_ is a serine protease invloved in cleaving carboxyl terminus of Lys [@PMID:6359954, @PMID:25823410].
Like trypsin, the optimum pH required for its activity is from pH 7-9. 
A major advantage of Lys-C is its resistance to denaturing agents, including 8 M urea - a chaotrope commonly used to denature proteins _prior_ to digestion [@PMID:27123950].
rypsin is less efficient in cleaving Lysthan aginine, which could limit the quality of quantitation from tryptic peptides.
Hence, to achieve complete protein digestion with minimal missed cleavages, Lys-C is often used in parallel to complement tryspin digestion [@PMID:23017020].

Alpha-lytic protease (aLP) is also secreted by the soil bacterial _Lysobacter enzymogenesis_ [@PMID:3053694].
Wild-type aLP (WaLP) and an active site mutant of aLP, M190A (MaLP), have been used to expand proteome coverage [@DOI:10.1074/mcp.m113.034710].
Based on observed peptide sequences from yeast proteome digestion, WaLP showed a specificity for small aliphatic amino acids like alanine, valine, and glycine, but also threonine and serine. 
MaLP showed a specificity for slightly larger amino acids like methionine, phenylalanine, and surprisingly, a preference for leucine over isoleucine. 
The specificity of WaLP for threonine enabled the first method for mapping endogenous human SUMO sites [@PMID:29079793].

Glutamyl peptidase I, commonly known as Glu-C or V8 protease, is a serine protease obtained from _Staphyloccous aureus_ [@PMID:4627743].
Glu-C cleaves at the C-terimus of glutamate, but also after aspartate [@PMID:4627743; @PMID:26748652].

Peptidyl-Asp metallopeptidase, commonly known as Asp-N, is a metalloprotease obtained from _Pseudomonas fragi_ [@PMID:2669754].
Asp-N catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds at the N-terminal of aspartate residues. 
The optimum activity of this enzyme is between pH 4 - 9.  
As with any metalloprotease, chelators like EDTA should be avoided for digestion buffers when using Asp-N.
Studies also suggest that Asp-N cleaves at the amino terminus of glutamate when a detergent is present in the proteolysis buffer [@PMID:2669754]. 
Asp-N often leaves many missed cleavages [@PMID:27123950].

Chymotrypsin or chymotrypsinogen A is a serine protease obtained from porcine or bovine pancreas with an optimum pH range from 7.8 to 8.0 [@PMID:3555886]. 
It cleaves at the C-terminus of hydrphobic amino acids Phe, Trp, Tyr and barely Met and Leu residues.
Since the transmembrane region of membrane proteins commonly lacks tryptic cleavage sites, this enzyme works well with membrane proteins having more hydrophobic residues [@PMID:24870543; @PMID:24696503; @PMID:27123950].
The chymotryptic peptides generated after proteolysis will cover the proteome space orthogonal to that of tryptic peptides both in a quantitative and qualitative manner [@PMID:24290761; @PMID:22669647; @PMID:24696503]

Clostripain, commonly known as Arg-C, is a cysteine protease obtained from _Clostridium histolyticum_ [@PMID:4332560].
It hydrolyses mostly the C-terminal Arg residues and sometimes Lys residues, but with less efficiency.
The peptides generated are generally longer than that of tryptic peptides.
Arg-C is often used with other proteases for improving qualitative proteome data and also for investigating PTMs [@PMID:25823410]. 

LysargiNase, also known as Ulilysin, is a recently discovered protease belonging to the metalloprotease family. 
It is a thermophilic protease derived from _Methanosarcina acetivorans_ that specifically cleaves at the N-terminus of Lys and Arg residues [@PMID:25419962].
Hence, it enabled discovery of C-terminal peptides that were not observed using trypsin.
In addition, it can also cleave modified amino acids such as methylated or dimethylated Arg and Lys [@PMID:25419962].

Peptidyl-Lys metalloendopeptidase, or Lys-N, is an metalloprotease obtained from _Grifola frondosa_ [@PMID:19195997]. 
It cleaves N-terminally of Lys and has an optimal activity at pH 9.0.
Unlike trypsin, Lys-N is more resistant to denaturing agents and can be heated up to 70 °C [@PMID:25823410].
Reports suggest that the peptides generated after Lys-N digestion produces more of c-type ions in a ETD-based mass spectrometer [@PMID:18425140]. 
Hence this can be used for analysing PTMs, identification of C-terminal peptides and also for de novo sequencing strategies [@PMID:18425140; @PMID:20953479].

Pepsin A, commonly known as pepsin, is an aspartic protease obtained from bovine or porcine pancreas [@PMID:12089768].
Pepsin was one of several proteins crystalized by John Northrop, who shared the 1946 Nobel prize in chemistry for this work [@PMID:19872561;@PMID:19872562; @PMID:17758437;@URL:https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1946/speedread/].
Pepsin works at an optimum pH from 1-4 and, in a pH-depended manner, it specifically cleaves Trp, Phe, Tyr and  Leu [@PMID:25823410]. 
Since it possess high enzyme activity and broad specificity at lower pH, it is preferred over other proteases for MS-based disulphide mapping [@PMID:12476442; @PMID:24980484].
Pepsin is also used extensively for structural mass spectrometry studies with hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) because the rate of back exchange of the amide deuteron is minimized at low pH [@DOI:10.1021/ac902477u; @DOI:10.1002/mas.21565].  
 
Proteinase K was first isolated from the mold _Tritirachium album_ Limber [@PMID:4373242]. 
The epithet 'K'is derived from its ability to efficiently hydrolyse keratin [@PMID:4373242].
It is a member of the subtilisin family of proteases and is relatively unspecific with a preference for cleaving at hydrophobic and aromatic amino acid residues and show optimal activity at pH 7.5 - 12 [@DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-382219-2.00714-6]. 
Proteinase K is used at low concentrations for limited proteolysis (LiP) and the detection of protein structural changes in the eponymous technique LiP-MS [@PMID:29072706].
