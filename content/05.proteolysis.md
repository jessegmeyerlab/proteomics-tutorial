## Proteolysis {.page_break_before}

Proteolysis is the defining step that differentiates bottom-up or shotgun proteomics from top-down proteomics. 
Hydrolysis of proteins is extremely important because it defines the population of potentially identifyable peptides. 
Generally peptides between a length of 7-35 amino acid are considered useful for mass spectrometry analysis.
Peptides that are too long are difficult to identify by tandem mass spectrometry, or may be lost during sample preparation due to 
Peptides that are too short are less likely to uniquely match to a single protein. 
There are many choices of enzymes and chemicals that hydrolyze proteins into peptides. 
This section summarizes potential choices and their strengths and weaknesses. 

Trypsin is the most common choice of protease for proteome hydrolysis [@DOI:10.1002/mas.21376].
