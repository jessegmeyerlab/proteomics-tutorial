## Proteolysis {.page_break_before}

Proteolysis is the defining step that differentiates bottom-up or shotgun proteomics from top-down proteomics. 
Hydrolysis of proteins is extremely important because it defines the population of potentially identifyable peptides. 
Generally peptides between a length of 7-35 amino acid are considered useful for mass spectrometry analysis.
Peptides that are too long are difficult to identify by tandem mass spectrometry, or may be lost during sample preparation due to 
Peptides that are too short are less likely to uniquely match to a single protein. 
There are many choices of enzymes and chemicals that hydrolyze proteins into peptides. 
This section summarizes potential choices and their strengths and weaknesses. 

Trypsin is the most common choice of protease for proteome hydrolysis [@DOI:10.1002/mas.21376].

5. Alternative enzyme choices (one paragraph each?) - 
The enzyme choice mostly depends on the application.
In general, for a mere protein identification mostly trypsin is the choice due to the reasons aforementioned.
However, alternative enzymes are used when the sequence information of a particular protein is limited in the database repositories. 
Especially, they serve as an advantage in improving the confidence of protein identification [@PMID:12643544].
In addition to that they also helps in improving the sensitivity and accuracy of protein identification in terms of the number of petides derived [@PMID:30336047].
