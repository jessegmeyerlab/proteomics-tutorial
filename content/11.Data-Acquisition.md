## Data Acquisition {.page_break_before}

Hybrid mass spectrometers used for modern proteome analysis offer the flexibility to collect data in many different ways. 
Data acquisition strategies differ in the sequence of precursor scans and fragment ion scans, and in how analytes are chosen for MS/MS. 
Constant innovation to develop better and better data collection methods improves our view of the proteome, but the many method options might be confusing for newcomers. 
This section provides an overview of these general classes of data collection methods. 

Data acquisition strategies for proteomics fall into one of two general groups.

1. Data dependent acquisition, or DDA, in which the exact scan sequence in each analysis depends on the data that the mass spectrometer sees.
2. Data independent acquisition, or DIA, in which the exact scan sequence in each analysis DOES NOT depend on the data; the scans are the same whether you inject yeast peptides, human peptides, or a solvent blank.  

DDA and DIA can both be futher subdivided in to targeted and untargeted methods. That is, we have targeted DDA, untargeted DDA, targeted DIA, or untargeted DIA.

### DDA
*start with history and background*

DDA was invented in the early 1990s, and it enabled collecting MS/MS spectra for peptides "on the fly" as soon as they start eluting from the column [@DOI:10.1006/meth.1994.1031; @DOI:10.1021/ac00104a020; @PMID:24203425]. 
This method is important because, in most cases, the peptide masses that will be observed are not known before doing the experiment. 


#### Untargeted DDA
A common method currently used in modern proteomics is untargeted DDA. 
The MS collects precursor (MS1) scans iteratively until precursor mass envelopes meeting certain criteria are detected. 
Criteria for selection are usually specific charge states and a minimum signal intensity.
When those ions meet these criteria, the MS selects those masses for fragmentation.

Because ions are selected as they are observed, repeated DDA of the same sample will produce a different set of identifications. 
This stochasticity is the main drawback of DDA. 
To ameliorate this issue, often strategies are used to transfer identifications between multiple sample analyses. 
This transfer of IDs across runs is known as "match between runs", which was originally made famous by the processing software MaxQaunt [@DOI:10.1074/mcp.M113.031591; @DOI:10.1038/nprot.2016.136]. 
There are several other similar tools and strategies, including the accurate mass and time approach [@DOI:10.1002/mas.20071], Q-MEND [@DOI:10.1021/pr0606880], IDEAL-Q [@DOI:10.1074/mcp.M900177-MCP200] and superHIRN [@DOI:10.1002/pmic.200700057].
More recent work has introducted statistical assessment of MBR methods using a two-proteome model [@DOI:10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00492].
Statistically controlled MBR is currently available in the IonQuant tool [@DOI:10.1016/j.mcpro.2021.100077].

#### Targeted DDA
Targeted DDA is not common in modern proteomics. 
In targeted DDA, in addition to general criteria like a minimum intensity and a certain charge state, the mass spectrometer looks for specific masses.
These masses might be previously observed signals that were previously missed by MS/MS [@DOI:10.1021/pr800828p; @DOI:10.1074/mcp.M700029-MCP200].
In these studies, the sample is first analyzed by LC-MS to detect precursor ion features with some software, and then subsequent analyses target those masses for fragmentation with inclusion lists until they are all fragmeted. 
This was shown to increase proteome converage.

#### DDA methods for modifications

There are also DDA methods that look for specific fragment or neutral loss ions in the resulting spectra. 
For example, when linear ion traps were the main proteomics workhorses, CID analysis of phosphopeptides would result in predominantly neutral loss of the phosphate with limited sequence ion information. 
To gain sequence ions in these experiemnts, instruments could be set to isolate a loss of 98 Thompsons for MS3 [@DOI:10.1073/pnas.0404720101; @DOI:10.1002/pmic.200800283].
The newer collisional dissociation technique HCD significantly improves the detection of peptide fragments with the phosphorylation intact on fragment ions, and thus, this neutral loss scanning technique is no longer common. 

A similar strategy was introduced for N-linked glycopeptides [@DOI:10.1021/pr300257c]. 
Collisional dissociation of glycosylated peptides produces oxonium ions at 204.09 (HexNAc) or 366.14 (HexHexNAc). 
In oxonium ions from the glycosylation were detected in the top 20 fragments of the HCD spectra, then an ETD scan was triggered. 
This ETD scan provides information about the peptide sequence, while the original HCD scan provides glycan structure information. 

### DIA
Imagine the simplest method to operate a mass spectrometer is to have predefined scans that are collected for each analysis.

#### Targeted DIA

#### Untargeted DIA

<!-- PASEF DIA -->

New data collection strategies are worthless without computational methods to extract proteomic information.
