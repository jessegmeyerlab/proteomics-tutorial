This unit describes the performance and analysis of a radiolabel pulse‐chase experiment for following the folding and cell surface trafficking of a trimeric murine MHC class I glycoprotein. In particular, the unit focuses on the precise timing of pulse‐chase experiments to evaluate early/short‐time events in protein maturation in both suspended and strictly adherent cell lines. The advantages and limitations of radiolabel pulse‐chase experiments are discussed, and a comprehensive section for troubleshooting is provided. Further, ways to quantitatively represent pulse‐chase results are described, and feasible interpretations on protein maturation are suggested. The protocols can be adapted to investigate a variety of proteins that may mature in very different ways. © 2014 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

The coupling of IMS with mass spectrometry (MS) greatly extends the capabilities and applications of the technique. This coupled technique, ion mobility–mass spectrometry (IM‐MS), has found utility in obtaining structural information on a variety of molecules with sizes spanning polyatomic ions to viruses. IM‐MS instruments are more routinely used as combined structurally selective and mass‐selective analytical separation devices allowing complex mixtures to be investigated. Furthermore, IM‐MS separations are conducted in the gas phase, which provides fast measurement capabilities that allow it to be compatible with other front‐end, condensed‐phase analytical separations, such as liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. This article provides a general overview of IM‐MS technology, notable advances in instrumentation, and examples of several applications across a broad range of fields.</jats:p>",

Several strategies can be used to analyze protein–protein interactions. Among them, affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry (AP‐MS) is arguably the most widely employed technique, not only owing to its high throughput and sensitivity but also because it can answer critical questions such as where, when, and how protein–protein interactions occur. In AP‐MS workflows, both the target protein and its interacting partners are isolated before being identified by MS. The main challenge of this approach is to distinguish <jats:italic>bona fide</jats:italic> binders from background contaminants. This review focuses on the different strategies designed to circumvent this limitation. In this regard, the combination of quantitative proteomics and affinity purification emerges as one of the most powerful, yet relatively simple, strategies to characterize protein–protein interactions. © IUBMB Life, 65(1):9–16, 2013</jats:p>",

LITs can be used either as ion accumulation devices or as commercially available, stand‐alone mass spectrometers with MS<jats:sup><jats:italic>n</jats:italic></jats:sup> capabilities. The combination of triple quadrupole MS with LIT technology in the form of an instrument of configuration QqLIT, using axial ejection, is particularly interesting, because this instrument retains the classical triple quadrupole scan functions such as selected reaction monitoring (SRM), product ion (PI), neutral loss (NL) and precursor ion (PC) while also providing access to sensitive ion trap experiments. For small molecules, quantitative and qualitative analysis can be performed using the same instrument. In addition, for peptide analysis, the enhanced multiply charged (EMC) scan allows an increase in selectivity, while the time‐delayed fragmentation (TDF) scan provides additional structural information. Various methods of operating the hybrid instrument are described for the case of the commercial Q TRAP (AB/MDS Sciex) and applications to drug metabolism analysis, quantitative confirmatory analysis, peptides analysis and automated nanoelectrospray (ESI‐chip‐MS) analysis are discussed.

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This tutorial presents the most common ion activation techniques employed in tandem mass spectrometry. In‐source fragmentation and metastable ion decompositions, as well as the general theory of unimolecular dissociations of ions, are initially discussed. This is followed by tandem mass spectrometry, which implies that the activation of ions is distinct from the ionization step, and that the precursor and product ions are both characterized independently by their mass/charge ratios. In collision‐induced dissociation (CID), activation of the selected ions occurs by collision(s) with neutral gas molecules in a collision cell. This experiment can be done at high (keV) collision energies, using tandem sector and time‐of‐flight instruments, or at low (eV range) energies, in tandem quadrupole and ion trapping instruments. It can be performed using either single or multiple collisions with a selected gas and each of these factors influences the distribution of internal energy that the activated ion will possess. While CID remains the most common ion activation technique employed in analytical laboratories today, several new methods have become increasingly useful for specific applications. More recent techniques are examined and their differences, advantages and disadvantages are described in comparison with CID. Collisional activation upon impact of precursor ions on solid surfaces, surface‐induced dissociation (SID), is gaining importance as an alternative to gas targets and has been implemented in several different types of mass spectrometers. Furthermore, unique fragmentation mechanisms of multiply‐charged species can be studied by electron‐capture dissociation (ECD). The ECD technique has been recognized as an efficient means to study non‐covalent interactions and to gain sequence information in proteomics applications. Trapping instruments, such as quadrupole ion traps and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance instruments, are particularly useful for the photoactivation of ions, specifically for fragmentation of precursor ions by infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD). IRMPD is a non‐selective activation method and usually yields rich fragmentation spectra. Lastly, blackbody infrared radiative dissociation is presented with a focus on determining activation energies and other important parameters for the characterization of fragmentation pathways. The individual methods are presented so as to facilitate the understanding of each mechanism of activation and their particular advantages and representative applications.

Crude oil has an extremely complex nature; hence, techniques with ultra‐high resolving capabilities, such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT‐ICR MS), are necessary. FT‐ICR MS has been successfully applied to the study of heavy and unconventional crude oils such as bitumen and shale oil. However, the analysis of crude oil with FT‐ICR MS is not trivial, and it has pushed analysis to the limits of instrumental and methodological capabilities. For example, high‐resolution mass spectra of crude oils may contain over 100,000 peaks that require interpretation. To visualize large data sets more effectively, data processing methods such as Kendrick mass defect analysis and statistical analyses have been developed. The successful application of FT‐ICR MS to the study of crude oil has been critically dependent on key developments in FT‐ICR MS instrumentation and data processing methods. This review offers an introduction to the basic principles, FT‐ICR MS instrumentation development, ionization techniques, and data interpretation methods for petroleomics and is intended for readers having no prior experience in this field of study. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Consequently, they represent attractive targets for drugs against gene‐related diseases. On the other hand, synthetic oligonucleotide analogues have found application as chemotherapeutic agents targeting cellular DNA and RNA. The development of effective nucleic acid‐based chemotherapeutic strategies requires adequate analytical techniques capable of providing detailed information about the nucleotide sequences, the presence of structural modifications, the formation of higher‐order structures, as well as the interaction of nucleic acids with other cellular components and chemotherapeutic agents. Due to the impressive technical and methodological developments of the past years, tandem mass spectrometry has evolved to one of the most powerful tools supporting research related to nucleic acids.

In large part, the interest in these methods is due to their ability to induce backbone fragmentation with very little disruption of noncovalent interactions which allows inference of information regarding higher order structure from the observed fragmentation behavior. Here, we review the evolution of electron‐based dissociation methods, and pay particular attention to their application in “native” mass spectrometry, their mechanism, determinants of fragmentation behavior, and recent developments in available instrumentation. Although we focus on the two most widely used methods—ECD and ETD—we also discuss the use of other ion/electron, ion/ion, and ion/neutral fragmentation methods, useful for interrogation of a range of classes of biomolecules in positive‐ and negative‐ion mode, and speculate about how this exciting field might evolve in the coming years.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This approach allows the investigation of the pathways of chemical and biochemical reactions, determination of structure, composition, and conformation of molecules. Mass spectrometry has now become one of the most important analytical tools for the monitoring of the isotopic exchange reactions. Investigation of conformational dynamics of proteins, quantitative measurements, obtaining chemical, and structural information about individual compounds of the complex natural mixtures are mainly based on the use of isotope exchange in combination with high resolution mass spectrometry. The most important reaction is the Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange, which is mainly performed in the solution. Recently we have developed the approach allowing performing of the Hydrogen/Deuterium reaction on‐line directly in the ionization source under atmospheric pressure. Such approach simplifies the sample preparation and can accelerate the exchange reaction so that certain hydrogens that are considered as non‐labile will also participate in the exchange. The use of in‐ionization source H/D exchange in modern mass spectrometry for structural elucidation of molecules serves as the basic theme in this review. We will focus on the mechanisms of the isotopic exchange reactions and on the application of in‐ESI, in‐APCI, and in‐APPI source Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange for the investigation of petroleum, natural organic matter, oligosaccharides, and proteins including protein‐protein complexes. The simple scenario for adaptation of H/D exchange reactions into mass spectrometric method is also highlighted along with a couple of examples collected from previous studies.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Using this approach, C‐reactive protein (CRP), a diagnostic marker of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), was detected in serum samples taken from patients with either erosive or nonerosive RA and compared to healthy individuals. Small volumes of serum samples were enriched for low‐abundance proteins through the selective removal of human serum albumin (HSA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and haptoglobin. After depletion of abundant proteins, the complexity of the protein mixture was further simplified using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to fractionate denatured proteins into discrete molecular weight ranges. Fractions of interest containing CRP, <jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>r</jats:sub> = 25 000, were pooled, digested with trypsin, and then fixed quantities of the synthetic peptides were added to the mixture. The mixture of tryptic peptides was subsequently analyzed by nanoflow chromatography‐tandem MS (nanoLC‐MS/MS) using multiple‐reaction monitoring (MRM) on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TQ‐MS). The ratio of transition ions derived from the endogenous and isotope‐labeled peptides provided a quantitative measure of CRP in the original samples as assessed by independent measurement of CRP in the same patient samples using an immunoassay. The use of isotope‐labeled synthetic peptides and MRM is a powerful analytical method for the prescreening of candidate protein biomarkers in human serum prior to antibody and immunoassay development.</jats:p>",

Both are affected by frequent and often overwhelming losses of phosphoric acid in ion trap CID fragmentation spectra. These losses are thought to translate into reduced intensities of sequence informative ions and a general decline in the quality of MS/MS spectra. To address this issue, several methods have been proposed, which rely on extended fragmentation schemes including collecting MS3 scans from neutral loss‐containing ions and multi‐stage activation to further fragment these same ions. Here, we have evaluated the utility of these methods in the context of a large‐scale phosphopeptide analysis strategy with current instrumentation capable of accurate precursor mass determination. Remarkably, we found that MS3‐based schemes did not increase the overall number of confidently identified peptides and had only limited value in site localization. We conclude that the collection of MS3 or pseudo‐MS3 scans in large‐scale proteomics studies is not worthwhile when high‐mass accuracy instrumentation is used.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Phospho‐proteomic studies opened a broad view onto the main mechanisms of regulating cellular processes. Our recent discovery of a protein arginine kinase and its target in bacteria added a previously undescribed type of phosphorylation to control protein activity. Several challenges arise from large in vivo studies of this and other types of phosphorylations. The main factors impeding correct localization are low spectral quality, neutral loss of phosphoric acid, and gas‐phase rearrangements, which have recently been described for phospho‐serine, ‐threonine, and ‐tyrosine. Studies on histidine‐phosphorylated peptides, a nitrogen‐bound phosphorylation, also reported loss of phosphoric acid upon collision‐induced dissociation. We were interested in studying the behaviour of arginine phosphorylation under different fragmentation conditions and its influence on site localization. First, we determined the percentage of false localizations obtained by three different search engines and a software tool dedicated for phospho‐site determination. Next, we demonstrate that application of collisional activation for analysis of arginine‐phosphorylated peptides leads to extensive elimination of phosphoric acid and increases the numbers of false localizations, while the modification is maintained on the arginine side chain upon electron‐transfer dissociation. Furthermore, we also observed a rearrangement of the phosphorylation onto serine and glutamic acid side chains upon collisional activation.</jats:p>",

The suspension trapping method combines the advantage of efficient SDS‐based protein extraction with rapid detergent removal, reactor‐type protein digestion, and peptide cleanup. Proteins are solubilized in SDS. The sample is acidified and introduced into the suspension trapping tip incorporating the depth filter and hydrophobic compartments, filled with the neutral pH methanolic solution. The instantly formed fine protein suspension is trapped in the depth filter stack—this crucial step is aimed at separating the particulate matter in space. SDS and other contaminants are removed in the flow‐through, and a protease is introduced. Following the digestion, the peptides are cleaned up using the tip's hydrophobic part. The methodology allows processing of protein loads down to the low microgram/submicrogram levels. The detergent removal takes about 5 min, whereas the tryptic proteolysis of a cellular lysate is complete in as little as 30 min. We have successfully utilized the method for analysis of cellular lysates, enriched membrane preparations, and immunoprecipitates. We expect that due to its robustness and simplicity, the method will become an essential proteomics tool.</jats:p>",

BioID relies on fusion of the protein of interest with a mutant form of the biotin ligase enzyme BirA (BirA*) that is capable of promiscuously biotinylating proximal proteins irrespective of whether these interact directly or indirectly with the fusion protein or are merely located in the same subcellular neighborhood. The covalent addition of biotin allows the labeled proteins to be purified from cell extracts on the basis of their affinity for streptavidin and identified by mass spectrometry. To date, BioID has been successfully applied to study a variety of proteins and processes in mammalian cells and unicellular eukaryotes and has been shown to be particularly suited to the study of insoluble or inaccessible cellular structures and for detecting weak or transient protein associations. Here, we provide an introduction to BioID, together with a detailed summary of where and how the method has been applied to date, and briefly discuss technical aspects involved in the planning and execution of a BioID study.</jats:p>",

One barrier to multi‐PTM studies is the time cost for both sample preparation and data acquisition, which scale linearly with the number of modifications. The most prohibitive requirement is often the need for large amounts of sample, which must be increased proportionally with the number of PTM enrichment steps. Here, a streamlined, quantitative label‐free proteomic workflow—“one‐pot” PTM enrichment—that enables comprehensive identification and quantification of peptides containing acetylated and succinylated lysine residues from a single sample containing as little as 1 mg mitochondria protein is described. Coupled with a label‐free, data‐independent acquisition (DIA), 2235 acetylated and 2173 succinylated peptides with the one‐pot method are identified and quantified and peak areas are shown to be highly correlated between the one‐pot and traditional single‐PTM enrichments. The ‘one‐pot’ method makes possible detection of multiple PTMs occurring on the same peptide, and it is shown that it can be used to make unique biological insights into PTM crosstalk. Compared to single‐PTM enrichments, the one‐pot workflow has equivalent reproducibility and enables direct assessment of PTM crosstalk from biological samples in less time from less tissue.</jats:p>",

The method oxidatively modifies solvent accessible sites in proteins, which changes upon alterations in the protein, such as ligand binding or a change in conformation. For HRF to provide accurate structural information, the method must probe the native structure of proteins. This requires careful experimental controls since an abundance of oxidative modifications can induce protein unfolding. Fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP) is a HRF method that generates hydroxyl radicals via photo‐dissociation of hydrogen peroxide using an excimer laser. The addition of a radical scavenger to the FPOP reaction reduces the lifetime of the radical, limiting the levels of protein oxidation. A direct assay is needed to ensure FPOP is probing the native conformation of the protein. Here, we report using enzymatic activity as a direct assay to validate that FPOP is probing the native structure of proteins. By measuring the catalytic activity of lysozyme and invertase after FPOP modification, we demonstrate that FPOP does not induce protein unfolding.</jats:p>",

This algorithm breaks the process into multiple steps. A rapid survey step identifies all protein sequences that are reasonable candidates for a match with a set of tandem mass spectra. These candidates are then used as models, which are refined by detailed analysis of the set of tandem mass spectra for evidence of incomplete enzymatic hydrolysis, non‐specific hydrolysis and chemical modifications of amino acid residues resulting from either post‐translational modifications or sample handling. Compared with current one‐step methods for matching proteins to mass spectra, this multiple‐step method can decrease the time required for the calculation by several orders of magnitude.

The objective of the experiments was to determine whether 266 nm UV irradiation on the phosphopeptide cations would induce unique peptide backbone dissociation. In addition, the general behavior of the phosphate loss (−80 or −98 Da) was monitored, particularly for those phosphopeptides with a phosphotyrosine residue that itself is a UV chromophore. For phosphopeptides with a UV chromophore, their photodissociation behavior was very similar to that of low‐energy sustained off‐resonance irradiation collisionally activated dissociation (SORI‐CAD), with a few exceptions. For example, <jats:italic>b</jats:italic>‐ and <jats:italic>y</jats:italic>‐type peptide backbone fragments were prevalent, and their dephosphorylation behavior was consistent with that of the SORI‐CAD results. For phosphoserine peptides, the loss of a phosphate group was always observed. On the other hand, for phosphotyrosine peptides, the phosphate loss was found to be dependent on the presence of a basic amino group in the sequence and the charge state of the precursor ions, in agreement with the CAD results in the literature. However, hydrogen atom loss or aromatic side chain loss, which is known to be the excited state specific fragmentation pathway, was rarely observed in our 266 nm UV PD experiments, in contrast to the previous UV PD literature (particularly at 220 nm). The mechanism for these observations is described in terms of dominant internal conversion followed by intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR).

Knowledge of the structure of protein–protein complexes but also of the binding affinity is of major importance to understand the biological function of protein–protein interactions. Even weak transient protein–protein interactions can be of functional relevance for the cell during signal transduction or regulation of metabolism. The structure of a growing number of protein–protein complexes has been solved in recent years. Combined with docking approaches or template‐based methods, it is possible to generate structural models of many putative protein–protein complexes or to design new protein–protein interactions. In order to evaluate the functional relevance of putative or predicted protein–protein complexes, realistic binding affinity prediction is of increasing importance. Several computational tools ranging from simple force‐field or knowledge‐based scoring of single protein–protein complexes to ensemble‐based approaches and rigorous binding free energy simulations are available to predict relative and absolute binding affinities of complexes. With a focus on molecular mechanics force‐field approaches the present review aims at presenting an overview on available methods and discussing advantages, approximations, and limitations of the various methods.</jats:p><jats:p>This article is categorized under:<jats:list list-type=\"simple\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Molecular and Statistical Mechanics &gt; Molecular Interactions</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Molecular and Statistical Mechanics &gt; Free Energy Methods</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Software &gt; Molecular Modeling</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list></jats:p>",

Most structural work to date has centred upon the native state of macromolecules, the most probable macromolecular form. But the native state of a molecule is merely its most abundant form, certainly not its only form. Thermodynamics requires that all other possible structural forms, however improbable, must also exist, albeit with representation corresponding to the factor exp( —<jats:italic>G</jats:italic><jats:sub>i</jats:sub>/<jats:italic>RT</jats:italic>) for each state of free energy<jats:italic>G</jats:italic><jats:sub>i</jats:sub>(see Moelwyn-Hughes, 1961), and one appreciates that each molecule within a population of molecules will in time explore the vast ensemble of<jats:italic>possible</jats:italic>structural states.</jats:p>",

In a mixed species comparison with fixed phosphopeptide ratios, we find LFQ and SILAC to be the most accurate techniques.

However, MS<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>-based TMT outperforms MS<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>-based TMT when analyzing phosphoproteome changes in the DNA damage response, since its higher precision and larger identification numbers allow detection of a greater number of significantly regulated phosphopeptides. Finally, we utilize the TMT multiplexing capabilities to develop an algorithm for determining phosphorylation site stoichiometry, showing that such applications benefit from the high accuracy of MS<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>-based TMT.</jats:p>",

These coordinates calibrate protein databases or spectrum libraries to a specific mass spectrometer and chromatography setup, facilitating DIA-only pipelines and the reuse of global resource libraries. We also present EncyclopeDIA, a software tool for generating and searching chromatogram libraries, and demonstrate the performance of our workflow by quantifying proteins in human and yeast cells. We find that by exploiting calibrated retention time and fragmentation specificity in chromatogram libraries, EncyclopeDIA can detect 20–25% more peptides from DIA experiments than with data dependent acquisition-based spectrum libraries alone.</jats:p>",

Varying the physicochemical properties of engineered NPs translates to distinct protein corona patterns enabling differential and reproducible interrogation of biological samples, including deep sampling of the plasma proteome. Spike experiments confirm a linear signal response. The median coefficient of variation was 22%. We screened 43 NPs and selected a panel of 5, which detect more than 2,000 proteins from 141 plasma samples using a 96-well automated workflow in a pilot non-small cell lung cancer classification study.

Traditional footprinting approaches, however, are hampered for integral membrane proteins because their transmembrane regions are not accessible to solvent, and they contain hydrophobic residues that are generally unreactive with most chemical reagents. To address this limitation, we bond photocatalytic titanium dioxide (TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) nanoparticles to a lipid bilayer. Upon laser irradiation, the nanoparticles produce local concentrations of radicals that penetrate the lipid layer, which is made permeable by a simultaneous laser-initiated Paternò–Büchi reaction. This approach achieves footprinting for integral membrane proteins in liposomes, helps locate both ligand-binding residues in a transporter and ligand-induced conformational changes, and reveals structural aspects of proteins at the flexible unbound state. Overall, this approach proves effective in intramembrane footprinting and forges a connection between material science and biology.</jats:p>",

Nanopore technology, which underpins long-read DNA and RNA sequencing, holds potential for full-length proteoform identification. We use electro-osmosis in an engineered charge-selective nanopore for the non-enzymatic capture, unfolding and translocation of individual polypeptides of more than 1,200 residues. Unlabelled thioredoxin polyproteins undergo transport through the nanopore, with directional co-translocational unfolding occurring unit by unit from either the C or N terminus. Chaotropic reagents at non-denaturing concentrations accelerate the analysis. By monitoring the ionic current flowing through the nanopore, we locate post-translational modifications deep within the polypeptide chains, laying the groundwork for compiling inventories of the proteoforms in cells and tissues.</jats:p>",

Through an enormous experimental effort<jats:sup>1–4</jats:sup>, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined<jats:sup>5</jats:sup>, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences<jats:sup>6,7</jats:sup>. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’<jats:sup>8</jats:sup>—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years<jats:sup>9</jats:sup>. Despite recent progress<jats:sup>10–14</jats:sup>, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.</jats:p>",

We propose a strategy, called pseudo-replicates of pseudo-samples (PRPS), for deploying our recently developed normalization method, called removing unwanted variation III (RUV-III), to remove the variation caused by library size, tumor purity and batch effects in TCGA RNA-seq data. We illustrate the value of our approach by comparing it to the standard TCGA normalizations on several TCGA RNA-seq datasets. RUV-III with PRPS can be used to integrate and normalize other large transcriptomic datasets coming from multiple laboratories or platforms.</jats:p>",

However, individual proteins are typically identified by peptide sequences representing a small fraction of their total amino acids. Hence, an average shotgun experiment fails to distinguish different protein variants and isoforms. Deeper proteome sequencing is therefore required for the global discovery of protein isoforms. Using six different human cell lines, six proteases, deep fractionation and three tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation methods, we identify a million unique peptides from 17,717 protein groups, with a median sequence coverage of approximately 80%. Direct comparison with RNA expression data provides evidence for the translation of most nonsynonymous variants. We have also hypothesized that undetected variants likely arise from mutation-induced protein instability. We further observe comparable detection rates for exon–exon junction peptides representing constitutive and alternative splicing events. Our dataset represents a resource for proteoform discovery and provides direct evidence that most frame-preserving alternatively spliced isoforms are translated.</jats:p>",

Various methods have been applied for handling missing values, but the selection can significantly affect following data analyses. Typically, there are three types of missing values, missing not at random (MNAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing completely at random (MCAR). Our study comprehensively compared eight imputation methods (zero, half minimum (HM), mean, median, random forest (RF), singular value decomposition (SVD), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and quantile regression imputation of left-censored data (QRILC)) for different types of missing values using four metabolomics datasets. Normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and NRMSE-based sum of ranks (SOR) were applied to evaluate imputation accuracy. Principal component analysis (PCA)/partial least squares (PLS)-Procrustes analysis were used to evaluate the overall sample distribution. Student’s <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>-test followed by correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects on univariate statistics. Our findings demonstrated that RF performed the best for MCAR/MAR and QRILC was the favored one for left-censored MNAR. Finally, we proposed a comprehensive strategy and developed a public-accessible web-tool for the application of missing value imputation in metabolomics (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://metabolomics.cc.hawaii.edu/software/MetImp/\">https://metabolomics.cc.hawaii.edu/software/MetImp/</jats:ext-link>).</jats:p>",

Imputation has been widely utilized to handle MVs, and selection of the proper method is critical for the accuracy and reliability of imputation. Here we present a comparative study that evaluates the performance of seven popular imputation methods with a large-scale benchmark dataset and an immune cell dataset. Simulated MVs were incorporated into the complete part of each dataset with different combinations of MV rates and missing not at random (MNAR) rates. Normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) was applied to evaluate the accuracy of protein abundances and intergroup protein ratios after imputation. Detection of true positives (TPs) and false altered-protein discovery rate (FADR) between groups were also compared using the benchmark dataset. Furthermore, the accuracy of handling real MVs was assessed by comparing enriched pathways and signature genes of cell activation after imputing the immune cell dataset. We observed that the accuracy of imputation is primarily affected by the MNAR rate rather than the MV rate, and downstream analysis can be largely impacted by the selection of imputation methods. A random forest-based imputation method consistently outperformed other popular methods by achieving the lowest NRMSE, high amount of TPs with the average FADR &lt; 5%, and the best detection of relevant pathways and signature genes, highlighting it as the most suitable method for label-free proteomics.</jats:p>",

No single metric captures all the desirable properties of a model, which is why several metrics are typically reported to summarize a model’s performance. Unfortunately, these measures are not easily understandable by many clinicians. Moreover, comparison of models across studies in an objective manner is challenging, and no tool exists to compare models using the same performance metrics. This paper looks at previous ML studies done in gastroenterology, provides an explanation of what different metrics mean in the context of binary classification in the presented studies, and gives a thorough explanation of how different metrics should be interpreted. We also release an open source web-based tool that may be used to aid in calculating the most relevant metrics presented in this paper so that other researchers and clinicians may easily incorporate them into their research.</jats:p>",

Advances in mass spectrometry over the past two decades have significantly expanded the list of known PTMs in biology and as instrumentation continues to improve, this list will surely grow. While many PTMs have been studied in detail (e.g. phosphorylation, acetylation), the vast majority lack defined mechanisms for their regulation and impact on cell fate. In this review, we will highlight the field of PTM research as it currently stands, discussing the mechanisms that dictate site specificity, analytical methods for their detection and study, and the chemical tools that can be leveraged to define PTM regulation. In addition, we will highlight the approaches needed to discover and validate novel PTMs. Lastly, this review will provide a starting point for those interested in PTM biology, providing a comprehensive list of PTMs and what is known regarding their regulation and metabolic origins.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it is crucial to understand at a molecular and at a systems level how proteins and RNAs form complexes and mutually affect their functions. In the present mini-review, we will first provide an overview of different mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods to study the RNA-binding proteome (RBPome), most of which are based on photochemical cross-linking. As we will show, some of these methods are also able to provide higher-resolution information about binding sites, which are important for the structural characterisation of protein–RNA interactions. In addition, classical structural biology techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and biophysical methods such as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and fluorescence-based methods contribute to a detailed understanding of the interactions between these two classes of biomolecules. We will discuss the relevance of such interactions in the context of the formation of membrane-less organelles (MLOs) by liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) processes and their emerging importance as targets for drug discovery.</jats:p>",

The evolution of the ion internal energy is then followed by a random walk simulation designed to be representative of the actual collisional energy transfer process, except ion losses due to dissociation and reactive processes during collisional activation are excluded. During the simulation, inelastic ion-neutral collisions increase the average ion internal energy via small energy changes (both positive and negative) until a steady-state condition is reached in which excitation and deexcitation processes are balanced.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Environmental contextChina has been experiencing severe particulate pollution and frequent haze episodes in recent years. We compare the molecular composition of urban organic aerosols on clear and hazy days in Beijing by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The comparative study shows that oxidation, sulfation and nitrification processes actively involve precursors of anthropogenic origin in the Beijing polluted urban atmosphere. AbstractHaze has frequently affected many cities and threatened human health in China. Detailed knowledge of the chemical composition of secondary organic aerosol provides fundamental information in the study of the formation mechanism of haze and its adverse effects on human health. In our work, dichloromethane and water extracts of ambient aerosols collected on hazy and clear days in Beijing were characterised by negative-ion electrospray ionisation and Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). Formulae in four elemental compositional groups, namely CHOS, CHONS, CHO and CHON, were identified relying on the ultrahigh resolution and mass accuracy of FT-ICR MS. Significantly more compounds were detected and the peaks were much more intense in the hazy day samples, especially for the CHOS, CHONS and CHON formula groups. Organosulfates (OS) and nitrooxy-organosulfates (nitrooxy OS) were the major forms of CHOS and CHONS formulae respectively, and their numbers more than tripled on the hazy days. Under the severely polluted conditions in Beijing, the compositional distribution of the OS and nitrooxy OS exhibited distinct features such as intense peaks of low double-bond equivalent (DBE) (DBE=0, 1 for OS and DBE=1, 2 for nitrooxy OS) and low degree oxidation, of medium DBE (DBE=2, 3 for OS and DBE=3, 4 for nitrooxy OS), and of high DBE (DBE ≥ 4 for OS and DBE ≥ 5 for nitrooxy OS). The likely respective candidates for these could be aliphatic OS having a low degree of oxidation, biogenic OS and many aromatics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-derived OS. The CHON formulae observed on hazy days were double those on clear days and had higher DBE values and larger O/N ratios. Slightly more CHO compounds were detected in the hazy-day samples and they had higher DBE values and more oxygen atoms. The comparative study suggests that oxidation, sulfation and nitrification processes actively involve precursors of anthropogenic origin in the Beijing polluted urban atmosphere.</jats:p>",

In the present work, we demonstrate that a combination of tandem phosphopeptide enrichment methods, high performance MS, and optimized database search/data filtering strategies is a powerful tool for surveying the phosphoproteome. Using our integrated analytical platform, we report the identification of 5,635 nonredundant phosphorylation sites from 2,328 proteins from mouse liver. From this list of sites, we extracted both novel and known motifs for specific Ser/Thr kinases including a “dipolar” motif. We also found that C-terminal phosphorylation was more frequent than at any other location and that the distribution of potential kinases for these sites was unique. Finally, we identified double phosphorylation motifs that may be involved in ordered phosphorylation.</jats:p>",

Using only the geometric constraints given by the resulting distance matrix we may construct 3D models without involving extensive conformation sampling. Our method successfully folded 21 of the 37 CASP12 hard targets with a median family size of 58 effective sequence homologs within 4 h on a Linux computer of 20 central processing units. In contrast, DCA-predicted contacts cannot be used to fold any of these hard targets in the absence of extensive conformation sampling, and the best CASP12 group folded only 11 of them by integrating DCA-predicted contacts into fragment-based conformation sampling. Rigorous experimental validation in CASP13 shows that our distance-based folding server successfully folded 17 of 32 hard targets (with a median family size of 36 sequence homologs) and obtained 70% precision on the top L/5 long-range predicted contacts. The latest experimental validation in CAMEO shows that our server predicted correct folds for 2 membrane proteins while all of the other servers failed. These results demonstrate that it is now feasible to predict correct fold for many more proteins lack of similar structures in the Protein Data Bank even on a personal computer.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Calmodulin (CaM) regulates many ion channels to control calcium entry into cells, and mutations that alter this interaction are linked to fatal diseases. The structural basis of CaM regulation remains largely unexplored. In retinal photoreceptors, CaM binds to the CNGB subunit of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels and, thereby, adjusts the channel’s Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) sensitivity in response to changes in ambient light conditions. Here, we provide the structural characterization for CaM regulation of a CNG channel by using a combination of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and structural proteomics. CaM connects the CNGA and CNGB subunits, resulting in structural changes both in the cytosolic and transmembrane regions of the channel. Cross-linking and limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry mapped the conformational changes induced by CaM in vitro and in the native membrane. We propose that CaM is a constitutive subunit of the rod channel to ensure high sensitivity in dim light. Our mass spectrometry-based approach is generally relevant for studying the effect of CaM on ion channels in tissues of medical interest, where only minute quantities are available.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The reversible phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is an important mechanism for modulating biological processes such as cellular signaling, differentiation, and growth, and if deregulated, can result in various types of cancer. Therefore, an understanding of these dynamic cellular processes at the molecular level requires the ability to assess changes in the sites of tyrosine phosphorylation across numerous proteins simultaneously as well as over time. Here we describe a sensitive approach based on multidimensional liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry that enables the rapid identification of numerous sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on a number of different proteins from human whole cell lysates. We used this methodology to follow changes in tyrosine phosphorylation patterns that occur over time during either the activation of human T cells or the inhibition of the oncogenic BCR-ABL fusion product in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells in response to treatment with STI571 (Gleevec). Together, these experiments rapidly identified 64 unique sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on 32 different proteins. Half of these sites have been documented in the literature, validating the merits of our approach, whereas motif analysis suggests that a number of the undocumented sites are also potentially involved in biological pathways. This methodology should enable the rapid generation of new insights into signaling pathways as they occur in states of health and disease.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>We have developed a new technique for proximity-dependent labeling of proteins in eukaryotic cells. Named BioID for proximity-dependent biotin identification, this approach is based on fusion of a promiscuous Escherichia coli biotin protein ligase to a targeting protein. BioID features proximity-dependent biotinylation of proteins that are near-neighbors of the fusion protein. Biotinylated proteins may be isolated by affinity capture and identified by mass spectrometry. We apply BioID to lamin-A (LaA), a well-characterized intermediate filament protein that is a constituent of the nuclear lamina, an important structural element of the nuclear envelope (NE). We identify multiple proteins that associate with and/or are proximate to LaA in vivo. The most abundant of these include known interactors of LaA that are localized to the NE, as well as a new NE-associated protein named SLAP75. Our results suggest BioID is a useful and generally applicable method to screen for both interacting and neighboring proteins in their native cellular environment.</jats:p>",

Here we report improvements to the BioID method centered on BioID2, a substantially smaller promiscuous biotin ligase. BioID2 enables more-selective targeting of fusion proteins, requires less biotin supplementation, and exhibits enhanced labeling of proximate proteins. Thus BioID2 improves the efficiency of screening for protein–protein associations. We also demonstrate that the biotinylation range of BioID2 can be considerably modulated using flexible linkers, thus enabling application-specific adjustment of the biotin-labeling radius. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Motivation: Gene expression microarray experiments can generate data sets with multiple missing expression values. Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating missing data.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: We present a comparative study of several methods for the estimation of missing values in gene microarray data. We implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the methods using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the amount of missing data over the range of 1–20% missing values. We show that KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row average method (as well as filling missing values with zeros). We report results of the comparative experiments and provide recommendations and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data under a variety of conditions.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Availability: The software is available at http://smi-web.stanford.edu/projects/helix/pubs/impute/</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Contact: russ.altman@stanford.edu</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>* To whom correspondence should be addressed.</jats:p>",

These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Availability: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Contact: bolstad@stat.berkeley.edu.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Supplementary information: Additional figures may be found at http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bolstad/normalize/index.html</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>* To whom correspondence should be addressed.</jats:p>",

Previously published methods for normalization primarily depend on the assumption that the distribution of protein expression is similar across all samples. However, this assumption fails when the protein expression data is generated from heterogenous samples, such as from various tissue types. This led us to develop a novel data-driven method for improved normalization to correct the systematic bias meanwhile maintaining underlying biological heterogeneity.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>To robustly correct the systematic bias, we used the density-power-weight method to down-weigh outliers and extended the one-dimensional robust fitting method described in the previous work to our structured data. We then constructed a robustness criterion and developed a new normalization algorithm, called RobNorm.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In simulation studies and analysis of real data from the genotype-tissue expression project, we compared and evaluated the performance of RobNorm against other normalization methods.

We have designed and implemented AlphaPeptStats, an inclusive Python package with currently with broad functionalities for normalization, imputation, visualization, and statistical analysis of label-free proteomics data. It modularly builds on the established stack of Python scientific libraries and is accompanied by a rigorous testing framework with 98% test coverage. It imports the output of a range of popular search engines. Data can be filtered and normalized according to user specifications. At its heart, AlphaPeptStats provides a wide range of robust statistical algorithms such as t-tests, analysis of variance, principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, and multiple covariate analysis—all in an automatable manner. Data visualization capabilities include heat maps, volcano plots, and scatter plots in publication-ready format.

As with any high-throughput technology, systematic biases are often observed in LC-MS data, making normalization an important preprocessing step. Normalization models need to be flexible enough to capture biases of arbitrary complexity, while avoiding overfitting that would invalidate downstream statistical inference. Careful normalization of MS peak intensities would enable greater accuracy and precision in quantitative comparisons of protein abundance levels.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: We propose an algorithm, called EigenMS, that uses singular value decomposition to capture and remove biases from LC-MS peak intensity measurements. EigenMS is an adaptation of the surrogate variable analysis (SVA) algorithm of Leek and Storey, with the adaptations including (i) the handling of the widespread missing measurements that are typical in LC-MS, and (ii) a novel approach to preventing overfitting that facilitates the incorporation of EigenMS into an existing proteomics analysis pipeline.

It is open source and freely available for academic and commercial use. The Skyline user interface simplifies the development of mass spectrometer methods and the analysis of data from targeted proteomics experiments performed using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Skyline supports using and creating MS/MS spectral libraries from a wide variety of sources to choose SRM filters and verify results based on previously observed ion trap data. Skyline exports transition lists to and imports the native output files from Agilent, Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific and Waters triple quadrupole instruments, seamlessly connecting mass spectrometer output back to the experimental design document. The fast and compact Skyline file format is easily shared, even for experiments requiring many sample injections. A rich array of graphs displays results and provides powerful tools for inspecting data integrity as data are acquired, helping instrument operators to identify problems early. The Skyline dynamic report designer exports tabular data from the Skyline document model for in-depth analysis with common statistical tools.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Availability: Single-click, self-updating web installation is available at http://proteome.gs.washington.edu/software/skyline.

Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10% to 30%. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Availability: The ℝ package missForest is freely available from http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Contact:  stekhoven@stat.math.ethz.ch; buhlmann@stat.math.ethz.ch</jats:p>",

We introduce Metriculator, a software designed to facilitate long-term storage of extensive performance metrics as introduced by NIST in 2010. Metriculator features a web interface that generates interactive comparison plots for contextual understanding of metric values and an automated metric generation toolkit. The comparison plots are designed for at-a-glance determination of outliers and trends in the datasets, together with relevant statistical comparisons. Easy-to-use quantitative comparisons and a framework for integration plugins will encourage a culture of quality assurance within the proteomics community.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Availability and Implementation: Available under the MIT license at http://github.com/princelab/metriculator.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Contact:  jtprince@chem.byu.edu</jats:p>",

There are more than 400 different types of PTMs affecting many aspects of protein functions. Such modifications happen as crucial molecular regulatory mechanisms to regulate diverse cellular processes. These processes have a significant impact on the structure and function of proteins. Disruption in PTMs can lead to the dysfunction of vital biological processes and hence to various diseases. High-throughput experimental methods for discovery of PTMs are very laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need for computational methods and powerful tools to predict PTMs. There are vast amounts of PTMs data, which are publicly accessible through many online databases. In this survey, we comprehensively reviewed the major online databases and related tools. The current challenges of computational methods were reviewed in detail as well.</jats:p>",

One way to generate such functional information is to infer biological relationships between genes/proteins, using a network of gene coexpression data that includes functional annotations. However, the lack of trustworthy functional annotations can impede the validation of such networks. Hence, there is a need for a principled method to construct gene coexpression networks that capture biological information and are structurally stable even in the absence of functional information.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>We introduce the concept of signed distance correlation as a measure of dependency between two variables, and apply it to generate gene coexpression networks. Distance correlation offers a more intuitive approach to network construction than commonly used methods such as Pearson correlation. We propose a framework to generate self-consistent networks using signed distance correlation purely from gene expression data, with no additional information. We analyse data from three different organisms to illustrate how networks generated with our method are more stable and capture more biological information compared to networks obtained from Pearson or Spearman correlations.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Code availability</jats:title><jats:p><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/javier-pardodiaz/sdcorGCN\">https://github.com/javier-pardodiaz/sdcorGCN</jats:ext-link>.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The cellular proteome, the ensemble of proteins derived from a genome, catalyzes and controls thousands of biochemical functions that are the basis of living cells. Whereas the protein coding regions of the genome of the human and many other species are well known, the complexity and composition of proteomes largely remains to be explored. This task is challenging because mechanisms including alternative splicing and post-translational modifications generally give rise to multiple distinct, but related proteins – proteoforms – per coding gene that expand the functional capacity of a cell.</jats:p><jats:p>Bottom-up proteomics is a mass spectrometric method that infers the identity and quantity of proteins from the measurement of peptides derived from these proteins by proteolytic digestion. Whereas bottom-up proteomics has become the method of choice for the detection of translation products from essentially any gene, the inherent missing link between measured peptides and their parental proteins has so far precluded the systematic assessment of proteoforms and thus limited the resolution of proteome maps. Here we present a novel, data-driven strategy to assign peptides to unique functional proteoform groups based on peptide correlation patterns across large bottom-up proteomic datasets. Our strategy does not fully characterize specific proteoforms, as is achievable in top-down approaches. Rather, it clusters peptides into functional proteoform groups that are directly linked to the biological context of the study. This allows the detection of tens to hundreds of proteoform groups in an untargeted fashion from bottom-up proteomics experiments.</jats:p><jats:p>We applied the strategy to two types of bottom-up proteomic datasets. The first is a protein complex co-fractionation dataset where native complexes across two different cell cycle stages were resolved and analyzed. Here, our approach enabled the systematic detection and evaluation of assembly specific proteoforms at an unprecedented scale. The second is a<jats:italic>protein abundance vs. sample</jats:italic>data matrix typical for bottom-up cohort studies consisting of tissue samples from the mouse BXD genetic reference panel. In either data type the method detected state-specific proteoform groups that could be linked to distinct molecular mechanisms including proteolytic cleavage, alternative splicing and phosphorylation. We envision that the presented approach lays the foundation for a systematic assessment of proteoforms and their functional implications directly from bottom-up proteomic datasets.</jats:p>",

There is a plethora of different computational tools that process the raw MS data and derive peptide and protein identification and quantification. During the last decade, there has been dramatic progress in computer science and software engineering, including collaboration tools that have transformed research and industry. To leverage these advances, we developed AlphaPept, a Python-based open-source framework for efficient processing of large high-resolution MS data sets. Using Numba for just-in-time machine code compilation on CPU and GPU, we achieve hundred-fold speed improvements while maintaining clear syntax and rapid development speed. AlphaPept uses the Python scientific stack of highly optimized packages, reducing the code base to domain-specific tasks while providing access to the latest advances in machine learning. We provide an easy on-ramp for community validation and contributions through the concept of literate programming, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks of the different modules. A framework for continuous integration, testing, and benchmarking enforces solid software engineering principles. Large datasets can rapidly be processed as shown by the analysis of hundreds of cellular proteomes in minutes per file, many-fold faster than the data acquisiton. The AlphaPept framework can be used to build automated processing pipelines using efficient HDF5 based file formats, web-serving functionality and compatibility with downstream analysis tools. Easy access for end-users is provided by one-click installation of the graphical user interface, for advanced users via a modular Python library, and for developers via a fully open GitHub repository.</jats:p>",

Although various machine learning methods have been developed to address this <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> sequencing problem, challenges that arise when modeling tandem mass spectra have led to complex models that combine multiple neural networks and post-processing steps.

Our experiments show that Casanovo achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset using a standard cross-species evaluation framework which involves testing with spectra with never-before-seen peptide labels. Casanovo not only achieves superior performance but does so at a fraction of the model complexity and inference time required by other methods.</jats:p>",

In particular, protein contaminants from reagents and sample handling are often abundant and almost impossible to avoid. For data-dependent acquisition (DDA) proteomics, exclusion list can be used to reduce the influence of protein contaminants. However, protein contamination has not been evaluated and is rarely addressed in data-independent acquisition (DIA). How protein contaminants influence proteomics data is also unclear. In this study, we established protein contaminant FASTA and spectral libraries that are applicable to all proteomic workflows and evaluated the impact of protein contaminants on both DDA and DIA proteomics. We demonstrated that including our contaminant libraries can reduce false discoveries and increase protein identifications, without influencing the quantification accuracy in various proteomic software platforms. With the pressing need to standardize proteomic workflow in the research community, we highly recommend including our contaminant FASTA and spectral libraries in all bottom-up proteomics workflow. Our contaminant libraries and a step-by-step tutorial to incorporate these libraries in different DDA and DIA data analysis platforms can be valuable resources for proteomics researchers, which are freely accessible at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/HaoGroup-ProtContLib\">https://github.com/HaoGroup-ProtContLib</jats:ext-link>.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Recent advances in mass spectrometry technology have seen remarkable increases in proteomic sequencing speed, while improvements to dynamic range have remained limited. An exemplar of this is the new timsTOF Pro instrument, which thanks to its trapped ion mobility, pushes effective fragmentation rates beyond 100Hz and provides accurate CCS values as well as impressive sensitivity. Established data dependent methodologies underutilize these advances by relying on long analytical columns and extended LC gradients to achieve comprehensive proteome coverage from biological samples. Here we describe the implementation of methods for short packed emitter columns that fully utilize instrument speed and CCS values by combining rapid generation of deep peptide libraries with enhanced matching of single shot data dependent sample analysis. Impressively, with only a 17 minute separation gradient (50 samples per day), the combination of high performance chromatography and CCS enhanced library based matching resulted in an average of 5,931 protein identifications within individual samples, and 7,244 proteins cumulatively across replicates from HeLa cell tryptic digests. Additionally, an ultra-high throughput setup utilizing 5 min gradients (180 samples per day) yielded an average of 3,666 protein identifications within individual samples and 4,659 proteins cumulatively across replicates. These workflows are simple to implement on available technology and do not require complex software solutions or custom-made consumables to achieve high throughput and deep proteome analysis from biological samples.</jats:p>",

This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.</jats:p>",

Tight integration with the ion injection process enables the high-resolution, mass accuracy, and sensitivity that have become essential for addressing analytical needs in numerous areas of research, as well as in routine analysis. We examine three major families of instruments (related to the LTQ Orbitrap, Q Exactive, and Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometers) in the context of their historical development over the past ten eventful years. We discuss as well future trends and perspectives of Orbitrap MS. We illustrate the compelling potential of Orbitrap-based mass spectrometers as (ultra) high-resolution platforms, not only for high-end proteomic applications, but also for routine targeted analysis. </jats:p>",

In recent years, electrospray ionization (ESI) has emerged as a technology through which particles with masses up to 100 MDa can be ionized and transferred into the gas phase, preparing them for accurate mass analysis. Here we review currently used methodologies, with a clear focus on native mass spectrometry (MS). Additional complementary methodologies are also covered, including ion-mobility analysis, nanomechanical mass sensors, and charge-detection MS. The literature discussed clearly demonstrates the great potential of ESI-based methodologies for the size and mass analysis of nanoparticles, including very large naturally occurring protein assemblies. The analytical approaches discussed are powerful tools in not only structural biology, but also nanotechnology. </jats:p>",

Overall, IDP-associated biological activities complement those of structured proteins. Recently, there has been an explosion of studies on IDP regions and their functions, yet the discovery and investigation of these proteins have a long, mostly ignored history. Along with recent discoveries, we present several early examples and the mechanisms by which IDPs contribute to function, which we hope will encourage comprehensive discussion of IDPs and IDP regions in biochemistry textbooks.

More than 100 rare human genetic disorders that result from deficiencies in the different glycosylation pathways are known today. Most of these disorders impact the central and/or peripheral nervous systems. Patients typically have developmental delays/intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, seizures, neuropathy, and metabolic abnormalities in multiple organ systems. Among these disorders there is great clinical diversity because all cell types differentially glycosylate proteins and lipids. The patients have hundreds of misglycosylated products, which afflict a myriad of processes, including cell signaling, cell-cell interaction, and cell migration. This vast complexity in glycan composition and function, along with the limited availability of analytic tools, has impeded the identification of key glycosylated molecules that cause pathologies. To date, few critical target proteins have been pinpointed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the postgenome era, biologists have sought to measure the complete complement of proteins, termed proteomics. Currently, the most effective method to measure the proteome is with shotgun, or bottom-up, proteomics, in which the proteome is digested into peptides that are identified followed by protein inference. Despite continuous improvements to all steps of the shotgun proteomics workflow, observed proteome coverage is often low; some proteins are identified by a single peptide sequence. Complete proteome sequence coverage would allow comprehensive characterization of RNA splicing variants and all posttranslational modifications, which would drastically improve the accuracy of biological models. There are many reasons for the sequence coverage deficit, but ultimately peptide length determines sequence observability. Peptides that are too short are lost because they match many protein sequences and their true origin is ambiguous. The maximum observable peptide length is determined by several analytical challenges. This paper explores computationally how peptide lengths produced from several common proteome digestion methods limit observable proteome coverage. Iterative proteome cleavage strategies are also explored. These simulations reveal that maximized proteome coverage can be achieved by use of an iterative digestion protocol involving multiple proteases and chemical cleavages that theoretically allow 92.9% proteome coverage.</jats:p>",

As a result, profiling tumor pTyr levels may reveal therapeutic insights critical to combating disease. Existing discovery and targeted mass spectrometry–based methods used to monitor pTyr networks involve a tradeoff between broad coverage of the pTyr network, reproducibility in target identification across analyses, and accurate quantification. To address these limitations, we developed a targeted approach, termed “SureQuant pTyr,” coupling low input pTyr enrichment with a panel of isotopically labeled internal standard peptides to guide data acquisition of low-abundance tyrosine phosphopeptides. SureQuant pTyr allowed for reliable quantification of several hundred commonly dysregulated pTyr targets with high quantitative accuracy, improving the robustness and usability of targeted mass spectrometry assays. We established the clinical applicability of SureQuant pTyr by profiling pTyr signaling levels in human colorectal tumors using minimal sample input, characterizing patient-specific oncogenic-driving mechanisms. While in some cases pTyr profiles aligned with previously reported proteomic, genomic, and transcriptomic molecular characterizations, we highlighted instances of new insights gained using pTyr characterization and emphasized the complementary nature of pTyr measurements with traditional biomarkers for improving patient stratification and identifying therapeutic targets. The turn-key nature of this approach opens the door to rapid and reproducible pTyr profiling in research and clinical settings alike and enables pTyr-based measurements for applications in precision medicine.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>SureQuant pTyr is a mass spectrometry–based targeted method that enables sensitive and selective targeted quantitation of several hundred low-abundance tyrosine phosphorylated peptides commonly dysregulated in cancer, including oncogenic signaling networks.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

However, especially non-targeted metabolite profiling approaches generate vast arrays of data that are prone to aberrations such as missing values. No matter the reason for the missing values in the data, coherent and complete data matrix is always a pre-requisite for accurate and reliable statistical analysis. Therefore, there is a need for proper imputation strategies that account for the missingness and reduce the bias in the statistical analysis.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>\n              <jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Here we present our results after evaluating nine imputation methods in four different percentages of missing values of different origin. The performance of each imputation method was analyzed by Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE). We demonstrated that random forest (RF) had the lowest NRMSE in the estimation of missing values for Missing at Random (MAR) and Missing Completely at Random (MCAR). In case of absent values due to Missing Not at Random (MNAR), the left truncated data was best imputed with minimum value imputation. We also tested the different imputation methods for datasets containing missing data of various origin, and RF was the most accurate method in all cases. The results were obtained by repeating the evaluation process 100 times with the use of metabolomics datasets where the missing values were introduced to represent absent data of different origin.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>\n              <jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Type and rate of missingness affects the performance and suitability of imputation methods.

Despite this popularity, there are concerns that these methods are being applied incorrectly and the results of some peer-reviewed publications are unreliable. These problems include the use of inappropriate background gene lists, lack of false discovery rate correction and lack of methodological detail. To ascertain the frequency of these issues in the literature, we performed a screen of 186 open-access research articles describing functional enrichment results. We find that 95% of analyses using over-representation tests did not implement an appropriate background gene list or did not describe this in the methods. Failure to perform p-value correction for multiple tests was identified in 43% of analyses. Many studies lacked detail in the methods section about the tools and gene sets used. An extension of this survey showed that these problems are not associated with journal or article level bibliometrics. Using seven independent RNA-seq datasets, we show misuse of enrichment tools alters results substantially. In conclusion, most published functional enrichment studies suffered from one or more major flaws, highlighting the need for stronger standards for enrichment analysis.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In numerous classification problems, class distribution is not balanced. For example, positive examples are rare in the fields of disease diagnosis and credit card fraud detection. General machine learning methods are known to be suboptimal for such imbalanced classification. One popular solution is to balance training data by oversampling the underrepresented (or undersampling the overrepresented) classes before applying machine learning algorithms. However, despite its popularity, the effectiveness of sampling has not been rigorously and comprehensively evaluated. This study assessed combinations of seven sampling methods and eight machine learning classifiers (56 varieties in total) using 31 datasets with varying degrees of imbalance. We used the areas under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) as the performance measures. The AUPRC is known to be more informative for imbalanced classification than the AUROC. We observed that sampling significantly changed the performance of the classifier (paired <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>-tests <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) only for few cases (12.2% in AUPRC and 10.0% in AUROC). Surprisingly, sampling was more likely to reduce rather than improve the classification performance. Moreover, the adverse effects of sampling were more pronounced in AUPRC than in AUROC. Among the sampling methods, undersampling performed worse than others. Also, sampling was more effective for improving linear classifiers. Most importantly, we did not need sampling to obtain the optimal classifier for most of the 31 datasets. In addition, we found two interesting examples in which sampling significantly reduced AUPRC while significantly improving AUROC (paired <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>-tests <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the applicability of sampling is limited because it could be ineffective or even harmful. Furthermore, the choice of the performance measure is crucial for decision making. Our results provide valuable insights into the effect and characteristics of sampling for imbalanced classification.</jats:p>",

However, MS is not without problems related to interference, especially through ion suppression effects. Ion suppression results from the presence of less volatile compounds that can change the efficiency of droplet formation or droplet evaporation, which in turn affects the amount of charged ion in the gas phase that ultimately reaches the detector.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Content: This review discusses materials shown to cause ion suppression, including salts, ion-pairing agents, endogenous compounds, drugs, metabolites, and proteins. Experimental protocols for examining ion suppression, which should include, at a minimum, signal recovery studies using specimen extracts with added analyte, are also discussed, and a more comprehensive approach is presented that uses postcolumn infusion of the analyte to evaluate protracted ionization effects. Finally, this review presents options for minimizing or correcting ion suppression, which include enhanced specimen cleanup, chromatographic changes, reagent modifications, and effective internal standardization.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Summary: Whenever mass spectrometric assays are developed, ion suppression studies should be performed using expected physiologic concentrations of the analyte under investigation.</jats:p>",

It is currently limited in proteomic depth, throughput, and robustness, which we address here by a streamlined multiplexed workflow using data‐independent acquisition (mDIA). We demonstrate automated and complete dimethyl labeling of bulk or single‐cell samples, without losing proteomic depth. Lys‐N digestion enables five‐plex quantification at MS1 and MS2 level. Because the multiplexed channels are quantitatively isolated from each other, mDIA accommodates a reference channel that does not interfere with the target channels. Our algorithm RefQuant takes advantage of this and confidently quantifies twice as many proteins per single cell compared to our previous work (Brunner <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>, PMID 35226415), while our workflow currently allows routine analysis of 80 single cells per day. Finally, we combined mDIA with spatial proteomics to increase the throughput of Deep Visual Proteomics seven‐fold for microdissection and four‐fold for MS analysis. Applying this to primary cutaneous melanoma, we discovered proteomic signatures of cells within distinct tumor microenvironments, showcasing its potential for precision oncology.</jats:p>",

More frequently, proteins do their jobs by acting as a roleplayer that interacts with other protein(s), which is more evident when the function of a protein is examined in the real context of a cell. Identifying the interactions between (or amongst) proteins is very crucial for the biochemistry investigation of an individual protein and for the attempts aiming to draw a holo-picture for the interacting members at the scale of proteomics (or protein-protein interactions mapping). Here, we introduced the currently available reporting systems that can be used to probe the interaction between candidate protein pairs based on the fragment complementation of some particular proteins. Emphasis was put on the principles and details of experimental design. These systems are dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), β-lactamase, tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease, luciferase, β- galactosidase, GAL4, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), green fluorescent protein (GFP), and ubiquitin.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Objective: This study aimed to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD using a combination of proteomics and machine learning approaches in a cohort that included African American/Black adults. Methods: We conducted a discovery-based plasma proteomics study on plasma samples (N = 113) obtained from clinically diagnosed AD and cognitively normal adults that were self-reported African American/Black or non-Hispanic White. Sets of differentially-expressed proteins were then classified using a support vector machine (SVM) to identify biomarker candidates. Results: In total, 740 proteins were identified of which, 25 differentially-expressed proteins in AD came from comparisons within a single racial and ethnic background group. Six proteins were differentially-expressed in AD regardless of racial and ethnic background. Supervised classification by SVM yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 and accuracy of 86%for differentiating AD in samples from non-Hispanic White adults when trained with differentially-expressed proteins unique to that group. However, the same model yielded an AUC of 0.49 and accuracy of 47%for differentiating AD in samples from African American/Black adults. Other covariates such as age, APOE4 status, sex, and years of education were found to improve the model mostly in the samples from non-Hispanic White adults for classifying AD. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the importance of study designs in AD biomarker discovery, which must include diverse racial and ethnic groups such as African American/Black adults to develop effective biomarkers.</jats:p>",

These systems act in a reversible manner and reduce off-target effects exceeding the limitations of CRISPR/Cas9 and RNA interference, respectively. Several TPI have been developed and wisely improved, including compartment delocalization tools and protein degradation systems. However, unlike chemical tools such as PROTACs (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras), which work in a wild-type genomic background, TPI technologies require adding an aminoacidic signal sequence (tag) to the protein of interest (POI). On the other hand, the design and optimization of PROTACs are very laborious and time-consuming. In this review, we focus on anchor-away, deGradFP, auxin-inducible degron (AID) and dTAG technologies and discuss their recent applications and advances. Finally, we propose nano-grad, a novel nanobody-based protein degradation tool, which specifically proteolyzes endogenous tag-free target protein.</jats:p>",

Due to their advantageous features, the CRISPR-Cas systems are already employed in several biological and medical research fields as the most suitable technique for genome engineering. In this review, we aim to describe the CRISPR-Cas systems that have been identified among prokaryotic organisms and engineered for genome manipulation studies. Furthermore, a comprehensive comparison between the innovative CRISPR-Cas methodology and the previously utilized ZFN and TALEN editing nucleases is also discussed.

A more recent class of split-FP variants, named « tripartite » split-FP, that rely on the self-assembly of three GFP fragments, is particularly well suited for the detection of protein–protein interactions. In this review, we describe the different steps and evolutions that have led to the diversification of superfolder and split-FP reporter systems, and we report an update of their applications in various areas of biology, from structural biology to cell biology.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Earlier this year we published a method article aimed at optimising protein extraction from mature buds of medicinal cannabis for trypsin-based shotgun proteomics (Vincent, D., et al. Molecules 2019, 24, 659). We then developed a top-down proteomics (TDP) method (Vincent, D., et al. Proteomes 2019, 7, 33). This follow-up study aims at optimising the digestion of medicinal cannabis proteins for identification purposes by bottom-up and middle-down proteomics (BUP and MDP). Four proteases, namely a mixture of trypsin/LysC, GluC, and chymotrypsin, which target different amino acids (AAs) and therefore are orthogonal and cleave proteins more or less frequently, were tested both on their own as well as sequentially or pooled, followed by nLC-MS/MS analyses of the peptide digests. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, 66 kDa) was used as a control of digestion efficiency. With this multiple protease strategy, BSA was reproducibly 97% sequenced, with peptides ranging from 0.7 to 6.4 kD containing 5 to 54 AA residues with 0 to 6 miscleavages. The proteome of mature apical buds from medicinal cannabis was explored more in depth with the identification of 27,123 peptides matching 494 unique accessions corresponding to 229 unique proteins from Cannabis sativa and close relatives, including 130 (57%) additional annotations when the list is compared to that of our previous BUP study (Vincent, D., et al. Molecules 2019, 24, 659). Almost half of the medicinal cannabis proteins were identified with 100% sequence coverage, with peptides composed of 7 to 91 AA residues with up to 9 miscleavages and ranging from 0.6 to 10 kDa, thus falling into the MDP domain. Many post-translational modifications (PTMs) were identified, such as oxidation, phosphorylations, and N-terminus acetylations. This method will pave the way for deeper proteome exploration of the reproductive organs of medicinal cannabis, and therefore for molecular phenotyping within breeding programs.</jats:p>",

In this study, phosphotyrosine networks triggered by CD3, CD28, or CD3 and CD28 costimulation were analyzed by site-specific quantitative phosphoproteomics, resulting in identification of 101 tyrosine and 3 threonine phosphorylation sites and quantification of 87 sites across four cell states. As expected, CD3 stimulation induced phosphorylation of CD3 chains and upstream components of TCR pathways such as Zap70, while CD28 stimulation induced phosphorylation of CD28, Vav-1, and other adaptor proteins including downstream of tyrosine kinase 1, Grb2-associated protein 2 (Grap2), and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. CD3 and CD28 costimulation induced a complex response including decreased threonine phosphorylation in the ERK1 and ERK2 activation loops and increased phosphorylation of selected tyrosine sites on ERK1/2, p38, phospholipase C-γ, Src homology 2 domain-containing transforming protein 1, Grap2, and Vav-1, potentiating T cell activation. Hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps were used to identify modules of coregulated phosphorylation sites within the network. Quantitative information in our study suggests quantitative and qualitative contribution by costimulation of CD28 on CD3-stimulated TCR signaling networks via enhanced phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ/Src homology 2 domain-containing transforming protein 1/Grap2/Vav-1 and their effects on downstream components including MAPKs.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "There has been an increase in the number of colorimetric assay techniques for the determination of protein concentration over the past 20 years. This has resulted in a perceived increase in sensitivity and accuracy with the advent of new techniques. The present review considers these advances with emphasis on the potential use of such technologies in the assay of biopharmaceuticals. The techniques reviewed include Coomassie Blue G-250 dye binding (the Bradford assay), the Lowry assay, the bicinchoninic acid assay and the biuret assay. It is shown that each assay has advantages and disadvantages relative to sensitivity, ease of performance, acceptance in the literature, accuracy and reproducibility/coefficient of variation/laboratory-to-laboratory variation. A comparison of the use of several assays with the same sample population is presented. It is suggested that the most critical issue in the use of a chromogenic protein assay for the characterization of a biopharmaceutical is the selection of a standard for the calibration of the assay; it is crucial that the standard be representative of the sample. If it is not possible to match the standard with the sample from the perspective of protein composition, then it is preferable to use an assay that is not sensitive to the composition of the protein such as a micro-Kjeldahl technique, quantitative amino acid analysis or the biuret assay. In a complex mixture it might be inappropriate to focus on a general method of protein determination and much more informative to use specific methods relating to the protein(s) of particular interest, using either specific assays or antibody-based methods. The key point is that whatever method is adopted as the 'gold standard' for a given protein, this method needs to be used routinely for calibration.",

    "abstract": "A novel procedure for micropurification of phosphorylated peptides, as a front end to mass spectrometric analysis, is described. As a result of a systematic study, we propose the use of an immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) in a microtip (Erdjument-Bromage, H.; et al. J. Chromatogr., A 1998, 826, 167-181) format, more specifically in combination with Ga(III) ions. Manual Ga-(III) IMAC is easy to perform; phosphopeptides are retrieved in a near-quantitative and highly selective manner, to yield a concentrated sample for direct analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight and nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Ga-(III) ions offer distinct advantages over the use of other metals, such as Fe(III) and Al(III), in terms of both selectivity and versatility, including facile base elution. Selectivity is best illustrated by effective enrichment of phosphopeptides that were present in a molar ratio of approximately 2% on a background of unphosphorylated protein, a situation very typical perhaps for protein phosphorylation states in the cell. The system was also used to retrieve and tentatively identify five previously uncharacterized phosphopeptides from a tryptic digest of human beta 4 integrin, isolated from cell extracts by immunoprecipitation.",

    "abstract": "KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions, linking genomic information with higher order functional information. The genomic information is stored in the GENES database, which is a collection of gene catalogs for all the completely sequenced genomes and some partial genomes with up-to-date annotation of gene functions. The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www. genome.ad.jp/kegg/).",

    "abstract": "Several algorithms have been described in the literature for protein identification by searching a sequence database using mass spectrometry data. In some approaches, the experimental data are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be compared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus produces a virulence factor, protein A (SpA), that contains five homologous Ig-binding domains. The interactions of SpA with the Fab region of membrane-anchored Igs can stimulate a large fraction of B cells, contributing to lymphocyte clonal selection. To understand the molecular basis for this activity, we have solved the crystal structure of the complex between domain D of SpA and the Fab fragment of a human IgM antibody to 2.7-A resolution. In the complex, helices II and III of domain D interact with the variable region of the Fab heavy chain (V(H)) through framework residues, without the involvement of the hypervariable regions implicated in antigen recognition. The contact residues are highly conserved in human V(H)3 antibodies but not in other families. The contact residues from domain D also are conserved among all SpA Ig-binding domains, suggesting that each could bind in a similar manner. Features of this interaction parallel those reported for staphylococcal enterotoxins that are superantigens for many T cells. The structural homology between Ig V(H) regions and the T-cell receptor V(beta) regions facilitates their comparison, and both types of interactions involve lymphocyte receptor surface remote from the antigen binding site. However, T-cell superantigens reportedly interact through hydrogen bonds with T-cell receptor V(beta) backbone atoms in a primary sequence-independent manner, whereas SpA relies on a sequence-restricted conformational binding with residue side chains, suggesting that this common bacterial pathogen has adopted distinct molecular recognition strategies for affecting large sets of B and T lymphocytes.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a novel protein chip technology that allows the high-throughput analysis of biochemical activities, and used this approach to analyse nearly all of the protein kinases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Protein chips are disposable arrays of microwells in silicone elastomer sheets placed on top of microscope slides. The high density and small size of the wells allows for high-throughput batch processing and simultaneous analysis of many individual samples. Only small amounts of protein are required. Of 122 known and predicted yeast protein kinases, 119 were overexpressed and analysed using 17 different substrates and protein chips. We found many novel activities and that a large number of protein kinases are capable of phosphorylating tyrosine. The tyrosine phosphorylating enzymes often share common amino acid residues that lie near the catalytic region. Thus, our study identified a number of novel features of protein kinases and demonstrates that protein chip technology is useful for high-throughput screening of protein biochemical activity.",

    "abstract": "Protein identification and peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry requires knowledge of how peptides fragment in the gas phase, specifically which bonds are broken and where the charge(s) resides in the products. For many peptides, cleavage at the amide bonds dominate, producing a series of ions that are designated b and y. For other peptides, enhanced cleavage occurs at just one or two amino acid residues. Surface-induced dissociation, along with gas-phase collision-induced dissociation performed under a variety of conditions, has been used to refine the general 'mobile proton' model and to determine how and why enhanced cleavages occur at aspartic acid residues and protonated histidine residues. Enhanced cleavage at acidic residues occurs when the charge is unavailable to the peptide backbone or the acidic side-chain. The acidic H of the side-chain then serves to initiate cleavage at the amide bond immediately C-terminal to Asp (or Glu), producing an anhydride. In contrast, enhanced cleavage occurs at His when the His side-chain is protonated, turning His into a weak acid that can initiate backbone cleavage by transferring a proton to the backbone. This allows the nucleophilic nitrogen of the His side-chain to attack and form a cyclic structure that is different from the 'typical' backbone cleavage structures.",

    "abstract": "Members of the Bcl2 family of proteins are important regulators of programmed cell death pathways with individual members that can suppress (eg Bcl2, Bcl-XL) or promote (eg Bax, Bad) apoptosis. While the mechanism(s) of Bcl2's anti-apoptotic function is not yet clear, introduction of Bcl2 into most eukaryotic cell types will protect the recipient cell from a wide variety of stress applications that lead to cell death. There are, however, physiologic situations in which Bcl2 expression apparently fails to protect cells from apoptosis (eg negative selection of thymocytes). Further, Bcl2 expression in patient tumor samples does not consistently correlate with a worse outcome or resistance to anticancer therapies. For example, patient response and survival following chemotherapy is independent of Bcl2 expression at least for pediatric patients with ALL. These findings indicate that simple expression of Bcl2 may not be enough to functionally protect cells from apoptosis. The finding that Bcl2 is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation suggests another level of regulation of function. Recent studies have shown that agonist-activated phosphorylation of Bcl2 at serine 70 (single site phosphorylation), a site within the flexible loop domain (FLD), is required for Bcl2's full and potent anti-apoptotic function, at least in murine IL-3-dependent myeloid cell lines. Several protein kinases have now been demonstrated to be physiologic Bcl2 kinases indicating the importance of this post-translational modification. Since Bcl2 phosphorylation has been found to be a dynamic process involving both a Bcl2 kinase(s) and phosphatase(s), a mechanism exists to rapidly and reversibly regulate Bcl2's activity and affect cell viability. In addition, multisite Bcl2 phosphorylation induced by anti-mitotic drugs like paclitaxel may inhibit Bcl2 indicating the potential wide range of functional consequences that this post-translational modification may have on function. While post-translational mechanisms other than phosphorylation may also regulate Bcl2's function (eg ubiquitination), this review will focus on the regulatory role for phosphorylation and discuss its potential clinical ramifications.",

    "abstract": "Dye-ligands have been considered as one of the important alternatives to natural counterparts for specific affinity chromatography. Dye-ligands are able to bind most types of proteins, in some cases in a remarkably specific manner. They are commercially available, inexpensive, and can easily be immobilized, especially on matrices bearing hydroxyl groups. Although dyes are all synthetic in nature, they are still classified as affinity ligands because they interact with the active sites of many proteins mimicking the structure of the substrates, cofactors, or binding agents for those proteins. A number of textile dyes, known as reactive dyes, have been used for protein purification. Most of these reactive dyes consist of a chromophore (either azo dyes, anthraquinone, or phathalocyanine), linked to a reactive group (often a mono- or dichlorotriazine ring). The interaction between the dye ligand and proteins can be by complex combination of electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding. Selection of the supporting matrix is the first important consideration in dye-affinity systems. There are several methods for immobilization of dye molecules onto the support matrix, in which usually several intermediate steps are followed. Both the adsorption and elution steps should carefully be optimized/designed for a successful separation. Dye-affinity systems in the form of spherical sorbents or as affinity membranes have been used in protein separation.",

    "abstract": "Studies on gastric digestion during 1820-1840 led to the discovery of pepsin as the agent which, in the presence of stomach acid, causes the dissolution of nutrients such as meat or coagulated egg white. Soon afterward it was shown that these protein nutrients were cleaved by pepsin to diffusible products named peptones. Efforts to isolate and purify pepsin were spurred by its widespread adoption for the treatment of digestive disorders, and highly active preparations were available by the end of the nineteenth century. There was uncertainty, however, as to the chemical nature of pepsin, for some preparations exhibited the properties of proteins while other preparations failed to do so. The question was not settled until after 1930, when Northrop crystallized swine pepsin and provided convincing evidence for its identity as a protein. The availability of this purified pepsin during the 1930s also led to the discovery of the first synthetic peptide substrates for pepsin, thus providing needed evidence for the peptide structure of native proteins, a matter of debate at that time. After 1945, with the introduction of new separation methods, notably chromatography and electrophoresis, and the availability of specific proteinases, the amino acid sequences of many proteins, including pepsin and its precursor pepsinogen, were determined. Moreover, treatment of pepsin with chemical reagents indicated the participation in the catalytic mechanism of two aspartyl units widely separated in the linear sequence. Studies on the kinetics of pepsin action on long chain synthetic peptides suggested that the catalytic site was an extended structure. Similar properties were found for other \"aspartyl proteinases,\" such as chymosin (used in cheese making), some intracellular proteinases (cathepsins), and plant proteinases. After 1975, the three-dimensional structures of pepsin and many of its relatives were determined by means of x-ray diffraction techniques, greatly extending our insight into the mechanism of the catalytic action of these enzymes. That knowledge has led to the design of new inhibitors of aspartyl proteinases, which are participants in the maturation of human immunodeficiency virus and in the generation of Alzheimer's disease.",

Employing the expectation maximization algorithm, the analysis learns to distinguish correct from incorrect database search results, computing probabilities that peptide assignments to spectra are correct based upon database search scores and the number of tryptic termini of peptides. Using SEQUEST search results for spectra generated from a sample of known protein components, we demonstrate that the computed probabilities are accurate and have high power to discriminate between correctly and incorrectly assigned peptides. This analysis makes it possible to filter large volumes of MS/MS database search results with predictable false identification error rates and can serve as a common standard by which the results of different research groups are compared.",

    "abstract": "The determination of disulfide bonds is an important aspect of gaining a comprehensive understanding of the chemical structure of a protein. The basic strategy for obtaining this information involves the identification of disulfide-linked peptides in digests of proteins and the characterization of their half-cystinyl peptide constituents. Tools for disulfide bond analysis have improved dramatically in the past two decades, especially in terms of speed and sensitivity. This improvement is largely due to the development of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI), and complementary analyzers with high resolution and accuracy. The process of pairing half-cystinyl peptides is now generally achieved by comparing masses of non-reduced and reduced aliquots of a digest of a protein that was proteolyzed with intact disulfide bonds. Pepsin has favorable properties for generating disulfide-linked peptides, including its acidic pH optimum, at which disulfide bond rearrangement is precluded and protein conformations are likely to be unfolded and accessible to cleavage, and broad substrate specificity. These properties potentiate cleavage between all half-cystine residues of the substrate protein. However, pepsin produces complex digests that contain overlapping peptides due to ragged cleavage. This complexity can produce very complex spectra and/or hamper the ionization of some constituent peptides. It may also be more difficult to compute which half-cystinyl sequences of the protein of interest are disulfide-linked in non-reduced peptic digests. This ambiguity is offset to some extent by sequence tags that may arise from ragged cleavages and aid sequence assignments. Problems associated with pepsin cleavage can be minimized by digestion in solvents that contain 50% H(2) (18)O. Resultant disulfide-linked peptides have distinct isotope profiles (combinations of isotope ratios and average mass increases) compared to the same peptides with only (16)O in their terminal carboxylates. Thus, it is possible to identify disulfide-linked peptides in digests and chromatographic fractions, using these mass-specific markers, and to rationalize mass changes upon reduction in terms of half-cystinyl sequences of the protein of interest. Some peptides may require additional cleavages due to their multiple disulfide bond contents and/or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to determine linkages. Interpretation of the MS/MS spectra of peptides with multiple disulfides in supplementary digests is also facilitated by the presence of (18)O in their terminal carboxylates.",

The enzymes used were trypsin, Lys-C, and Asp-N, which cleave at arginine and lysine residues, lysine, and aspartic acid residues, respectively. This approach was evaluated with the glycoprotein, tissue plasminogen activator, t-PA and gave enhanced sequence coverage, compared with a single enzymatic digest. The approach was then evaluated with a complex proteomic sample, namely plasma. It was found that trypsin and Lys-C were able to detect overlapping but distinct sets of proteins and a digital recombination of the data gave a significant increase in both the number of protein identifications as well as an increase in the number of peptides identified per protein (which improves the certainty of the assignment).",

    "abstract": "We developed a sensitive fluorescence assay for the quantitation of proteins in solution using the NanoOrange reagent, a merocyanine dye that produces a large increase in fluorescence quantum yield upon interaction with detergent-coated proteins. The NanoOrange assay allowed for the detection of 10 ng/mL to 10 micrograms/mL protein with a standard fluorometer, offering a broad, dynamic quantitation range and improved sensitivity relative to absorption-based protein solution assays. The protein-to-protein variability of the NanoOrange assay was comparable to those of standard assays, including Lowry, bicinchoninic acid, and Bradford procedures. We also found that the NanoOrange assay is useful for detecting relatively small proteins or large peptides, such as aprotinin and insulin. The assay was somewhat sensitive to the presence of several common contaminants found in protein preparations such as salts and detergents; however, it was insensitive to the presence of reducing agents, nucleic acids, and free amino acids. The simple assay protocol is suitable for automation. Samples are briefly heated in the presence of dye in a detergent-containing diluent, allowed to cool to room temperature, and fluorescence is measured using 485-nm excitation and 590-nm emission wavelengths. Therefore, the NanoOrange assay is well suited for use with standard fluorescence microplate readers, fluorometers, and some laser scanners.",

    "abstract": "Cytoscape is an open source software project for integrating biomolecular interaction networks with high-throughput expression data and other molecular states into a unified conceptual framework. Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.",

Peptides that correspond to more than a single protein in the sequence database are apportioned among all corresponding proteins, and a minimal protein list sufficient to account for the observed peptide assignments is derived using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Using peptide assignments to spectra generated from a sample of 18 purified proteins, as well as complex H. influenzae and Halobacterium samples, the model is shown to produce probabilities that are accurate and have high power to discriminate correct from incorrect protein identifications. This method allows filtering of large-scale proteomics data sets with predictable sensitivity and false positive identification error rates. Fast, consistent, and transparent, it provides a standard for publishing large-scale protein identification data sets in the literature and for comparing the results obtained from different experiments.",

Protein identifications from 0.5 pg of whole proteome extracts were enabled by ultrahigh sensitivity (<75 zmol for individual proteins) achieved using high-efficiency (peak capacities of approximately 10(3)) 15-microm-i.d. capillary liquid chromatography separations (i.e., using nanoLC, approximately 20 nL/min mobile-phase flow rate at the optimal linear velocity of approximately 0.2 cm/s) coupled on-line with a micro-solid-phase sample extraction and a nanoscale electrospray ionization interface to a 11.4-T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer (MS). Proteome measurement coverage improved as sample size was increased from as little as 0.5 pg of sample. It was found that a 2.5-ng sample provided 14% coverage of all annotated open reading frames for the microorganism Deinococcus radiodurans, consistent with previous results for a specific culture condition. The estimated detection dynamic range for detected proteins was 10(5)-10(6). An improved accurate mass and LC elution time two-dimensional data analysis methodology, used to both speed and increase the confidence of peptide/protein identifications, enabled identification of 872 proteins/run from a single 3-h nanoLC/FTICR MS analysis. The low-zeptomole-level sensitivity provides a basis for extending proteomics studies to smaller cell populations and potentially to a single mammalian cell. Application with ion trap MS/MS instrumentation allowed protein identification from 50 pg (total mass) of proteomic samples (i.e., approximately 100 times larger than FTICR MS), corresponding to a sensitivity of approximately 7 amol for individual proteins. Compared with single-stage FTICR measurements, ion trap MS/MS provided a much lower proteome measurement coverage and dynamic range for a given analysis time and sample quantity.",

To find the most efficient method for sample preparation, we used human plasma and compared four widely applied precipitation methods, using trichloroacetic acid (TCA), acetone, chloroform/methanol and ammonium sulfate, as well as ultrafiltration. Precipitation with TCA and acetone and ultrafiltration resulted in an efficient sample concentration and desalting. We also found that ammonium sulfate fractionation can efficiently remove albumin, which represents more than 50% of plasma proteins.",

These reagents may be used to modify proteins in solution, as well as proteins in gel slices, prior to proteolytic digestion and mass spectral analysis. The procedure eliminates several steps with both types of samples. Samples in solution do not need to be desalted following reduction and alkylation, with excess reagent being removed under vacuum. For gel slices, the procedure combines washing, destaining, reduction and alkylation into a single step. The procedure was applied successfully to samples as complex as serum, and we demonstrated alkylation of cysteines to be quantitative in purified proteins. We also were able to reduce and alkylate proteins with these reagents during the gas phase. Elimination of the need for desalting of samples after reaction raised the possibility of automation of the procedure for liquid samples, which is difficult with conventional reduction and alkylation chemistries.",

    "abstract": "We describe here a multiplexed protein quantitation strategy that provides relative and absolute measurements of proteins in complex mixtures. At the core of this methodology is a multiplexed set of isobaric reagents that yield amine-derivatized peptides. The derivatized peptides are indistinguishable in MS, but exhibit intense low-mass MS/MS signature ions that support quantitation. In this study, we have examined the global protein expression of a wild-type yeast strain and the isogenic upf1Delta and xrn1Delta mutant strains that are defective in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and the general 5' to 3' decay pathways, respectively. We also demonstrate the use of 4-fold multiplexing to enable relative protein measurements simultaneously with determination of absolute levels of a target protein using synthetic isobaric peptide standards. We find that inactivation of Upf1p and Xrn1p causes common as well as unique effects on protein expression.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is known to function in cell survival in response to various stresses; however, the mechanism of cell survival by ERK1/2 remains poorly elucidated in ischemic heart. Here we applied functional proteomics by two-dimensional electrophoresis to identify a cellular target of ERK1/2 in response to ischemic hypoxia. Approximately 1500 spots were detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of a sample from unstimulated cells. The staining intensities of at least 50 spots increased at 6-h reoxygenation after 2-h ischemic hypoxia. Of the 50 spots that increased, at least 4 spots were inhibited in the presence of PD98059, a MEK inhibitor. A protein with a molecular mass of 52 kDa that is strongly induced by ERK1/2 activation in response to ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation was identified as alpha-enolase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and amino acid sequencing. The expressions of the alpha-enolase mRNA and protein are inhibited during reoxygenation after ischemic hypoxia in the cells containing a dominant negative mutant of MEK1 and treated with a MEK inhibitor, PD98059, leading to a decrease in ATP levels. alpha-Enolase expression is also observed in rat heart subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. The induction of alpha-enolase by ERK1/2 appears to be mediated by c-Myc. The introduction of the alpha-enolase protein into the cells restores ATP levels and prevents cell death during ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation in these cells. These results show that alpha-enolase expression by ERK1/2 participates in the production of ATP during reoxygenation after ischemic hypoxia, and a decrease in ATP induces apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, alpha-enolase improves the contractility of cardiomyocytes impaired by ischemic hypoxia. Our results reveal that ERK1/2 plays a role in the contractility of cardiomyocytes and cell survival through alpha-enolase expression during ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation.",

    "abstract": "Tyrosine kinases play a prominent role in human cancer, yet the oncogenic signaling pathways driving cell proliferation and survival have been difficult to identify, in part because of the complexity of the pathways and in part because of low cellular levels of tyrosine phosphorylation. In general, global phosphoproteomic approaches reveal small numbers of peptides containing phosphotyrosine. We have developed a strategy that emphasizes the phosphotyrosine component of the phosphoproteome and identifies large numbers of tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Peptides containing phosphotyrosine are isolated directly from protease-digested cellular protein extracts with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody and are identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Applying this approach to several cell systems, including cancer cell lines, shows it can be used to identify activated protein kinases and their phosphorylated substrates without prior knowledge of the signaling networks that are activated, a first step in profiling normal and oncogenic signaling networks.",

    "abstract": "Most proteins do not evolve in isolation, but as components of complex genetic networks. Therefore, a protein's position in a network may indicate how central it is to cellular function and, hence, how constrained it is evolutionarily. To look for an effect of position on evolutionary rate, we examined the protein-protein interaction networks in three eukaryotes: yeast, worm, and fly. We find that the three networks have remarkably similar structure, such that the number of interactors per protein and the centrality of proteins in the networks have similar distributions. Proteins that have a more central position in all three networks, regardless of the number of direct interactors, evolve more slowly and are more likely to be essential for survival. Our results are thus consistent with a classic proposal of Fisher's that pleiotropy constrains evolution.",

Here, we present a direct comparison of these two first-dimensional techniques using complex protein samples derived from the testis of Rattus norvegicus. It was found that the use of immobilized pH gradients (narrow range pH 3.5-4.5) for peptide separation in the first dimension yielded 13% more protein identifications than the optimized off-line SCX approach (employing the entire pI range of the sample). In addition, the IPG technique allows for a much more efficient use on mass spectrometer analysis time. Separation of a tryptic digest derived from a rat testis sample on a narrow range pH gradient (over the 3.5-4.5 pH range) yielded 7626 and 2750 peptides and proteins, respectively. Peptide and protein identification was performed with high confidence using SEQUEST in combination with a data filtering program employing pI and statistical based functions to remove false-positives from the data.",

    "abstract": "Proteins can become modified by a large number of reactions involving reactive oxygen species. Among these reactions, carbonylation has attracted a great deal of attention due to its irreversible and unrepairable nature. Carbonylated proteins are marked for proteolysis by the proteasome and the Lon protease but can escape degradation and form high-molecular-weight aggregates that accumulate with age. Such carbonylated aggregates can become cytotoxic and have been associated with a large number of age-related disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. This review focuses on the generation of and defence against protein carbonyls and speculates on the potential role of carbonylation in protein quality control, cellular deterioration, and senescence.",

    "abstract": "Reversible phosphorylation of proteins regulates the majority of all cellular processes, e.g. proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. A fundamental understanding of these biological processes at the molecular level requires characterization of the phosphorylated proteins. Phosphorylation is often substoichiometric, and an enrichment procedure of phosphorylated peptides derived from phosphorylated proteins is a necessary prerequisite for the characterization of such peptides by modern mass spectrometric methods. We report a highly selective enrichment procedure for phosphorylated peptides based on TiO2microcolumns and peptide loading in 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB). The effect of DHB was a very efficient reduction in the binding of nonphosphorylated peptides to TiO2 while retaining its high binding affinity for phosphorylated peptides. Thus, inclusion of DHB dramatically increased the selectivity of the enrichment of phosphorylated peptides by TiO2. We demonstrated that this new procedure was more selective for binding phosphorylated peptides than IMAC using MALDI mass spectrometry. In addition, we showed that LC-ESI-MSMS was biased toward monophosphorylated peptides, whereas MALDI MS was not. Other substituted aromatic carboxylic acids were also capable of specifically reducing binding of nonphosphorylated peptides, whereas phosphoric acid reduced binding of both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides. A putative mechanism for this intriguing effect is presented.",

    "abstract": "Ligand binding to cell surface receptors initiates a cascade of signaling events regulated by dynamic phosphorylation events on a multitude of pathway proteins. Quantitative features, including intensity, timing, and duration of phosphorylation of particular residues, may play a role in determining cellular response, but experimental data required for analysis of these features have not previously been available. To understand the dynamic operation of signaling cascades, we have developed a method enabling the simultaneous quantification of tyrosine phosphorylation of specific residues on dozens of key proteins in a time-resolved manner, downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Tryptic peptides from four different EGFR stimulation time points were labeled with four isoforms of the iTRAQ reagent to enable downstream quantification. After mixing of the labeled samples, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides were immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and further enriched by IMAC before LC/MS/MS analysis. Database searching and manual confirmation of peptide phosphorylation site assignments led to the identification of 78 tyrosine phosphorylation sites on 58 proteins from a single analysis. Replicate analyses of a separate biological sample provided both validation of this first data set and identification of 26 additional tyrosine phosphorylation sites and 18 additional proteins. iTRAQ fragment ion ratios provided time course phosphorylation profiles for each site. The data set of quantitative temporal phosphorylation profiles was further characterized by self-organizing maps, which resulted in identification of several cohorts of tyrosine residues exhibiting self-similar temporal phosphorylation profiles, operationally defining dynamic modules in the EGFR signaling network consistent with particular cellular processes. The presence of novel proteins and associated tyrosine phosphorylation sites within these modules indicates additional components of this network and potentially localizes the topological action of these proteins. Additional analysis and modeling of the data generated in this study are likely to yield more sophisticated models of receptor tyrosine kinase-initiated signal transduction, trafficking, and regulation.",

    "abstract": "We report the results of a systematic investigation to quantify the losses of protein during a well-established two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) procedure. Radioactively labelled proteins ([(14)C]bovine serum albumin and a homogenate prepared from the liver of a rat that had been injected with [(35)S]methionine) were used, and recovery was quantified by digesting pieces of gel in H(2)O(2) and subjecting the digests to liquid scintillation counting. When samples were loaded onto the first dimension immobilised pH gradient strips by in-gel rehydration, recovery of protein from the strips was 44-80% of the amount of protein loaded, depending on the amount of protein in the sample. Most of the unrecovered protein appeared to have adhered to the reswelling tray. Losses during isoelectric focusing (IEF) were much smaller (7-14%), although approximately 2% of the protein appeared to migrate from sample strips to adjacent blank strips in the focussing apparatus. A further 17-24% of the proteins were lost into the buffers during equilibration prior to running in the second dimension. Losses during the second dimension run and subsequent staining with SYPRO Ruby amounted to less than 10%. The overall loss during 2-DE was reduced by approximately 25% when proteins were loaded onto the IEF strips using sample cups instead of by in-gel rehydration. These extensive and variable losses during the 2-DE procedure mean that spot intensities on 2-DE gels cannot be used to derive reliable, quantitative information on the amounts of proteins present in the original sample.",

    "abstract": "The shotgun proteomic strategy based on digesting proteins into peptides and sequencing them using tandem mass spectrometry and automated database searching has become the method of choice for identifying proteins in most large scale studies. However, the peptide-centric nature of shotgun proteomics complicates the analysis and biological interpretation of the data especially in the case of higher eukaryote organisms. The same peptide sequence can be present in multiple different proteins or protein isoforms. Such shared peptides therefore can lead to ambiguities in determining the identities of sample proteins. In this article we illustrate the difficulties of interpreting shotgun proteomic data and discuss the need for common nomenclature and transparent informatic approaches. We also discuss related issues such as the state of protein sequence databases and their role in shotgun proteomic analysis, interpretation of relative peptide quantification data in the presence of multiple protein isoforms, the integration of proteomic and transcriptional data, and the development of a computational infrastructure for the integration of multiple diverse datasets.",

    "abstract": "The need to identify protein or peptide biomarkers via readily available biological samples like serum, plasma, or cerebrospinal fluid is often hindered by a few particular proteins present at relatively high concentrations. The ability to remove these proteins specifically, reproducibly, and with high selectivity is increasingly important in proteomic studies, and success in this procedure is leading to an ever-increasing list of lower abundant proteins being identified in these biological fluids. The current work addresses some of the potential problems in depleting proteins in typical biomarker studies, including nonspecific binding during depletion procedures and whether low molecular weight (LMW) species bind to the column in a so-called \"sponge\" effect caused by the ability of albumin or other high-abundant proteins to bind peptides or protein fragments. LC-MS/MS methods were applied to the comparative analysis of an IgG-based immunodepletion method and a Cibacron blue (CB)-dye-based method, for specificity of removing targeted proteins (binding fraction), as well as for assessing efficiency of target removal. This analysis was extended to examine the effects of repeated use of materials (cycles of binding and elution), in order to assess potential for carryover of one sample to the next. Capacity studies and efficiency of protein removal from the serum samples were followed for the IgG-based system using both immunochemical assays (ELISA) as well as LC-MS/MS methods. Additionally, the IgG-based system was further characterized for the removal of LMW polypeptides by nonspecific binding. We conclude that the IgG-based system provided effective removal of targeted proteins, with minimal carryover, high longevity, and minimal nonspecific binding. Significant differences are noted between the depletion techniques employed, and this should be considered based on the expectations set during experimental design.",

In this work, we represent the chaotropic agent as a factor that reduces the amount of order in the structures formed by water molecules, both in the bulk and the hydration shells around hydrophobic amino acids. In this framework we show that low chaotrope concentrations lead to a destabilization of the native state of proteins, and that high concentrations induce complete denaturation. We also find that the reduction of the number of bulk ordered states of water molecules can give origin to an effective interaction between chaotropic molecules and proteins.",

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.",

The most popular 2D-HPLC approach used today for proteomic research combines strong cation exchange and reversed-phase HPLC. We have evaluated an alternative mode for 2D-HPLC of peptides, employing reversed-phase columns in both separation dimensions. The orthogonality of 2D separation was investigated for selected types of RP stationary phases, ion-pairing agents and mobile phase pH. The pH appears to have the most significant impact on the RP-LC separation selectivity; the greatest orthogonality was achieved for the system with C18 columns using pH 10 in the first and pH 2.6 in the second LC dimension. Separation was performed in off-line mode with partial fraction evaporation. The achievable peak capacity in RP-RP-HPLC and overall performance compares favorably to SCX-RP-HPLC and holds promise for proteomic analysis.",

The overall process of collisional activation followed by fragmentation of the ion is commonly referred to as collision-induced dissociation (CID).

We now report that the small molecular receptors bearing binuclear Zn(II)-Dpa can strongly bind to a bis-phosphorylated peptide in a cross-linking manner under neutral aqueous conditions when the distance between the two Zn(II) centers can appropriately fit in that of the two phosphate groups of the phosphorylated peptide. The binding property was quantitatively determined by ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry), induced CD (circular dichroism), and NMR. On the basis of these findings, we demonstrated that these types of small molecules were able to effectively disrupt the phosphoprotein-protein interaction in a phosphorylated CTD peptide and the Pin1 WW domain, a phosphoprotein binding domain, at a micromolar level. The strategy based on a small molecular disruptor that directly interacts with phosphoprotein is unique and should be promising in developing a designer inhibitor for phosphoprotein-protein interaction.",

    "abstract": "The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network has a small number of highly connected protein nodes (known as hubs) and many poorly connected nodes. Genome-wide studies show that deletion of a hub protein is more likely to be lethal than deletion of a non-hub protein, a phenomenon known as the centrality-lethality rule. This rule is widely believed to reflect the special importance of hubs in organizing the network, which in turn suggests the biological significance of network architectures, a key notion of systems biology. Despite the popularity of this explanation, the underlying cause of the centrality-lethality rule has never been critically examined. We here propose the concept of essential PPIs, which are PPIs that are indispensable for the survival or reproduction of an organism. Our network analysis suggests that the centrality-lethality rule is unrelated to the network architecture, but is explained by the simple fact that hubs have large numbers of PPIs, therefore high probabilities of engaging in essential PPIs. We estimate that approximately 3% of PPIs are essential in the yeast, accounting for approximately 43% of essential genes. As expected, essential PPIs are evolutionarily more conserved than nonessential PPIs. Considering the role of essential PPIs in determining gene essentiality, we find the yeast PPI network functionally more robust than random networks, yet far less robust than the potential optimum. These and other findings provide new perspectives on the biological relevance of network structure and robustness.",

This paper illustrates the effectiveness of OFFGEL electrophoresis with the Agilent 3100 OFFGEL Fractionator for the fractionation of peptides. An Escherichia coli tryptic digest was separated in 24 fractions, and peptides were identified by reversed-phase liquid chromatography on a microfluidic device with mass spectrometric detection. About 90% of the identified individual peptides were found in only one or two fractions. The distribution of the calculated isoelectric points for the peptides identified in each fraction was especially narrow in the acidic pH range. Standard deviations approached the size of the pH segment covered by the respective fraction. The experimental peptide isoelectric point measured by OFFGEL electrophoresis was used as an additional filter for validation of peptide identifications.",

    "abstract": "Detergents have been widely used for the solubilization of membrane proteins and the improvement of their digestion. In this paper, we have evaluated the application of sodium deoxycholate (SDC) to the solubilization and digestion of rat hippocampal plasma membrane (PM) proteins. For in-solution digestion, rat hippocampal PM fraction from sucrose-density gradient centrifugation was solubilized by boiling in 1.0% SDC, and directly digested without dilution. During the in-gel digestion of the hippocampal PM proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, 0.1% SDC was added. Before analysis of peptide mixture by liquid chromatography and electrospray mass spectrometry, SDC in the tryptic digests was removed by centrifugation following acidification. Use of 1.0% SDC in solubilization and in-solution digestion of rat PM proteins had led to 77 PM or membrane-associated proteins identified, a more than 2-fold increase over that by use of SDS. The addition of 0.1% SDC to the in-gel digestion of SDS-PAGE-resolved membrane proteins remarkably enhanced the coverage of tryptic peptides and the number of hydrophobic membrane proteins identified. Being a cheaper and more tractable acid-insoluble detergent, SDC could be used at higher concentration in the solubilization and tryptic digestion of proteins including PM proteins with the purpose of enhancing the protein solubility and at the same time making no interference with trypsin activity and subsequent analyses.",

    "abstract": "Protein interactions are crucial components of all cellular processes. Recently, high-throughput methods have been developed to obtain a global description of the interactome (the whole network of protein interactions for a given organism). In 2002, the yeast interactome was estimated to contain up to 80,000 potential interactions. This estimate is based on the integration of data sets obtained by various methods (mass spectrometry, two-hybrid methods, genetic studies). High-throughput methods are known, however, to yield a non-negligible rate of false positives, and to miss a fraction of existing interactions. The interactome can be represented as a graph where nodes correspond with proteins and edges with pairwise interactions. In recent years clustering methods have been developed and applied in order to extract relevant modules from such graphs. These algorithms require the specification of parameters that may drastically affect the results. In this paper we present a comparative assessment of four algorithms: Markov Clustering (MCL), Restricted Neighborhood Search Clustering (RNSC), Super Paramagnetic Clustering (SPC), and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE).",

    "abstract": "Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become the preferred method for conducting large-scale surveys of proteomes. Automated interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra can be problematic, however, for a variety of reasons. As most sequence search engines return results even for 'unmatchable' spectra, proteome researchers must devise ways to distinguish correct from incorrect peptide identifications. The target-decoy search strategy represents a straightforward and effective way to manage this effort. Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, some controversy surrounds its successful application. Here we clarify our preferred methodology by addressing four issues based on observed decoy hit frequencies: (i) the major assumptions made with this database search strategy are reasonable; (ii) concatenated target-decoy database searches are preferable to separate target and decoy database searches; (iii) the theoretical error associated with target-decoy false positive (FP) rate measurements can be estimated; and (iv) alternate methods for constructing decoy databases are similarly effective once certain considerations are taken into account.",

    "abstract": "It has been a long-standing goal in systems biology to find relations between the topological properties and functional features of protein networks. However, most of the focus in network studies has been on highly connected proteins (\"hubs\"). As a complementary notion, it is possible to define bottlenecks as proteins with a high betweenness centrality (i.e., network nodes that have many \"shortest paths\" going through them, analogous to major bridges and tunnels on a highway map). Bottlenecks are, in fact, key connector proteins with surprising functional and dynamic properties. In particular, they are more likely to be essential proteins. In fact, in regulatory and other directed networks, betweenness (i.e., \"bottleneck-ness\") is a much more significant indicator of essentiality than degree (i.e., \"hub-ness\"). Furthermore, bottlenecks correspond to the dynamic components of the interaction network-they are significantly less well coexpressed with their neighbors than non-bottlenecks, implying that expression dynamics is wired into the network topology.",

    "abstract": "Prefractionation procedures facilitate the identification of lower-abundance proteins in proteome analysis. Here we have optimized the conditions for immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) to enrich for phosphoproteins. The metal ions, Ga(III), Fe(III), Zn(II), and Al(III), were compared for their abilities to trap phosphoproteins; Ga(III) was the best. Detailed analyses of the pH and ionic strength for IMAC enabled us to determine the optimal conditions (pH 5.5 and 0.5 m NaCl). When whole cell lysates were fractionated in this way, about one-tenth of the total protein was recovered in the eluate, and the recovery of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was more than 90%. Phosphorylated forms of ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and Akt were also enriched efficiently under the same conditions. Our Ga(III) IMAC and a commercially available purification kit for phosphoproteins performed similarly, with a slight difference in the spectrum of phosphoproteins. When phosphoproteins enriched from NIH3T3 cells in which ERK was either activated or suppressed were analyzed by two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis, phosphorylated ERK was detected as discrete spots unique to ERK-activated cells, which overlapped with surrounding spots in the absence of prefractionation. We applied the same technique to search for Akt substrates and identified Abelson interactor 1 as a novel potential target. These results demonstrate the efficacy of phosphoprotein enrichment by IMAC and suggest that this procedure will be of general use in phosphoproteome research.",

    "abstract": "Cellular responses to DNA damage are mediated by a number of protein kinases, including ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related). The outlines of the signal transduction portion of this pathway are known, but little is known about the physiological scope of the DNA damage response (DDR). We performed a large-scale proteomic analysis of proteins phosphorylated in response to DNA damage on consensus sites recognized by ATM and ATR and identified more than 900 regulated phosphorylation sites encompassing over 700 proteins. Functional analysis of a subset of this data set indicated that this list is highly enriched for proteins involved in the DDR. This set of proteins is highly interconnected, and we identified a large number of protein modules and networks not previously linked to the DDR. This database paints a much broader landscape for the DDR than was previously appreciated and opens new avenues of investigation into the responses to DNA damage in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Following on our recent work, on-line one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) porous layer open tubular/liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (PLOT/LC-ESI-MS) platforms using 3.2 mx10 microm i.d. poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) (PS-DVB) PLOT columns have been developed to provide robust, high-performance, and ultrasensitive proteomic analysis. With the use of a PicoClear tee, the dead volume connection between a 50 microm i.d. PS-DVB monolithic micro-SPE column and the PLOT column was minimized. The micro-SPE/PLOT column assembly provided a separation performance similar to that obtained with direct injection onto the PLOT column at a mobile phase flow rate of 20 nL/min. The trace analysis potential of the platform was evaluated using an in-gel tryptic digest sample of a gel fraction (15-40 kDa) of a cervical cancer (SiHa) cell line. As an example of the sensitivity of the system, approximately 2.5 ng of protein in 2 microL of solution, an amount corresponding to 20 SiHa cells, was subjected to on-line micro-SPE-PLOT/LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis using a linear ion trap MS. A total of 237 peptides associated with 163 unique proteins were identified from a single analysis when using stringent criteria associated with a false positive rate of less than 1%. The number of identified peptides and proteins increased to 638 and 343, respectively, as the injection amount was raised to approximately 45 ng of protein, an amount corresponding to 350 SiHa cells. In comparison, only 338 peptides and 231 unique proteins were identified (false positive rate again less than 1%) from 750 ng of protein from the identical gel fraction, an amount corresponding to 6000 SiHa cells, using a typical 15 cmx75 microm i.d. packed capillary column. The greater sensitivity, higher recovery, and higher resolving power of the PLOT column resulted in the increased number of identifications from only approximately 5% of the injected sample amount. The resolving power of the micro-SPE/PLOT assembly was further extended by 2D chromatography via combination of the high-efficiency reversed-phase PLOT column with strong cation-exchange chromatography (SCX). As an example, 1071 peptides associated with 536 unique proteins were identified from 75 ng of protein from the same gel fraction, an amount corresponding to 600 cells, using five ion-exchange fractions in on-line 2D SCX-PLOT/LC-MS. The 2D system, implemented in an automated format, led to simple and robust operation for proteomic analysis. These promising results demonstrate the potential of the PLOT column for ultratrace analysis.",

    "abstract": "Several label-free quantitation strategies have been introduced that obliterate the need for expensive isotopically labeled molecules. However label-free approaches have considerably higher demands in respect of repeatability of sample preparation and fractionation than multiplexing isotope labeling-based strategies. OFFGEL fractionation promises the necessary separation efficiency and repeatability. To test this platform, 12-fraction peptide OFFGEL electrophoresis and online reversed-phase LC connected to a quadrupole TOF mass spectrometer were used to determine differences of the physiological, pathological and biochemical distinct extraocular muscle allotype in comparison to hind-limb muscle. Close to 70% of the peptides separated by OFFGEL electrophoresis were detected only in a single fraction. To determine the separation repeatability of four samples, we compared the ion volumes of multiple peptides deriving from the thick filament-associated protein titin over several fractions and determined a coefficient of variation below 20%. Of the 474 proteins identified, 61 proteins were differently expressed between the two muscle allotypes and were involved in metabolism, muscle contraction, stress response, or gene expression. Several expression differences were validated using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. We therefore consider peptide OFFGEL fractionation an effective and efficient addition to our label-free quantitative proteomics workflow.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a new protocol for digesting hydrophobic proteins using trypsin with the aid of phase-transfer surfactants (PTS), such as sodium deoxycholate (SDC). SDC increases the solubility of hydrophobic proteins, enhances the activity of trypsin, and improves the accessibility to trypsin of proteins denatured during the extraction process. After digestion, SDC was successfully removed from the acidified solution containing tryptic peptides by adding a water-immiscible organic solvent, into which SDC was predominantly transferred, while the digested peptides remained in the aqueous phase. Compared with a protocol using an acid-labile surfactant, this PTS protocol increased the number of identified proteins and the recovery of hydrophobic peptides in the analysis of 400 ng of a membrane-enriched fraction of Escherichia coli. Application of the PTS protocol to 9.0 microg of a membrane-enriched pellet from human cervical cancer HeLa cells resulted in identification of a total of 1450 proteins, of which 764 (53%) were membrane proteins, by two-dimensional strong cation exchange (SCX)-C18 LC-MSMS with 5 SCX fractions. The distribution of the number of transmembrane domains in proteins identified in this study was in agreement with that in the IPI human database, suggesting that the PTS protocol can provide unbiased digestion of the membrane proteome.",

    "abstract": "In proteomics, nanoflow multidimensional chromatography is now the gold standard for the separation of complex mixtures of peptides as generated by in-solution digestion of whole-cell lysates. Ideally, the different stationary phases used in multidimensional chromatography should provide orthogonal separation characteristics. For this reason, the combination of strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) and reversed-phase (RP) chromatography is the most widely used combination for the separation of peptides. Here, we review the potential of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) as a separation tool in the multidimensional separation of peptides in proteomics applications. Recent work has revealed that HILIC may provide an excellent alternative to SCX, possessing several advantages in the area of separation power and targeted analysis of protein post-translational modifications.

    "abstract": "Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) is becoming increasingly popular for separation of polar samples on polar columns in aqueous-organic mobile phases rich in organic solvents (usually ACN). Silica gel with decreased surface concentration of silanol groups, or with chemically bonded amino-, amido-, cyano-, carbamate-, diol-, polyol-, or zwitterionic sulfobetaine ligands are used as the stationary phases for HILIC separations, in addition to the original poly(2-sulphoethyl aspartamide) strong cation-exchange HILIC material. The type of the stationary and the composition of the mobile phase play important roles in the mixed-mode HILIC retention mechanism and can be flexibly tuned to suit specific separation problems. Because of excellent mobile phase compatibility and complementary selectivity to RP chromatography, HILIC is ideally suited for highly orthogonal 2-D LC-LC separations of complex samples containing polar compounds, such as peptides, proteins, oligosaccharides, drugs, metabolites and natural compounds. This review attempts to present an overview of the HILIC separation systems, possibilities for their characterization and emerging HILIC applications in 2-D off-line and on-line LC-LC separations of various samples, in combination with RP and other separation modes.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the protein composition of complex extracts or discovering biologically relevant polypeptides is frequently hindered by large dynamic concentration ranges. The presence of high-abundance proteins suppresses the signal of low-abundance ones, and the most rare proteins are frequently below the sensitivity of available analytical methods. This protocol addresses this problem by using highly diversified hexapeptide ligand libraries for capturing proteins. A protein extract is mixed with the library and because the library has equal amounts of each ligand, theoretically the maximum amount of each protein bound is the same. Under overloading conditions this has the effect of diluting those proteins present in excess of the ligand concentration and concentrating those of relatively lower abundance. Unbound components are washed out and captured species are finally desorbed. The entire sample treatment process takes about half a day and yields a protein solution that could be used as such for mass spectrometry investigations.",

Knowledge of identity enables their use as internal calibrants for accurate mass measurements. This review/tutorial summarizes current literature on reported contaminants and introduces a number of novel interferences that have been observed and identified in our laboratories over the past decade. These include both compounds of proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous nature.

Since the discovery that selectins and their glycan ligands are important for the regulation of leukocyte trafficking, it has been shown that additional features of the vertebrate immune system are also controlled by endogenous cellular glycosylation.

    "abstract": "Proteomic analysis typically has been performed using proteins digested with trypsin because of the excellent fragmentation patterns they produce in collision induced dissociation (CID). For analyses in which high protein coverage is desirable, such as global monitoring of post-translational modifications, additional sequences can be seen using parallel digestion with a second enzyme. We have benchmarked a relatively obscure basidomycete-derived zinc metalloendopeptidase, Lys-N, that selectively cleaves the amide bond N-terminal of lysine residues. We have found that Lys-N digestion yields peptides with easily assigned CID spectra. Using a mixture of purified proteins as well as a complex yeast lysate, we have shown that Lys-N efficiently digests all proteins at the predicted sites of cleavage. Shotgun proteomics analyses of Lys-N digests of both the standard mixture and yeast lysate yielded peptide and protein identification numbers that were generally comparable to trypsin digestion, whereas the combination data from Lys-N and trypsin digestion substantially enhanced protein coverage. During CID fragmentation, the additional amino terminal basicity enhanced b-ion intensity which was reflected in long b-ion tags that were particularly pronounced during CID in a quadrupole. Finally, immonium ion peaks produced from Lys-N digested peptides originate from the carboxy terminus in contrast to tryptic peptides where immonium ions originate from the amino terminus.",

    "abstract": "Accurate quantification of protein expression in biological systems is an increasingly important part of proteomics research. Incorporation of differential stable isotopes in samples for relative protein quantification has been widely used. Stable isotope incorporation at the peptide level using dimethyl labeling is a reliable, cost-effective and undemanding procedure that can be easily automated and applied in high-throughput proteomics experiments. Although alternative multiplex quantitative proteomics approaches introduce isotope labels at the organism level ('stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture' (SILAC)) or enable the simultaneous analysis of eight samples (isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)), stable isotope dimethyl labeling is advantageous in that it uses inexpensive reagents and is applicable to virtually any sample. We describe in-solution, online and on-column protocols for stable isotope dimethyl labeling of sample amounts ranging from sub-micrograms to milligrams. The labeling steps take approximately 60-90 min, whereas the full protocol including digestion and (two-dimensional) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry takes approximately 1.5-3 days to complete.",

    "abstract": "Depletion of high-abundance proteins is regarded as a critical sample preparation step for most plasma proteomic analyses and profiling strategies. This report describes a process that rapidly and reproducibly precipitates high-abundance disulfide-rich proteins, including albumin and transferrin, from serum and plasma. A low volume of concentrated reducing agent, viz. dithiothreitol (DTT) or tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), was added directly to plasma followed by a brief incubation at ambient temperature. Removal of the precipitate via centrifugation and identification of the protein content revealed an albumin-enriched pellet. Direct analysis of the supernatant by MALDI-TOF-MS afforded peptidome and small protein profiles with enhanced features and minimal ionization of full-length albumin. The reproducible and quantitative nature of the method has been demonstrated by monitoring the plasma levels of an antiangiogenic protein biologic, rKringle5 (rK5). The 10.5-kDa analyte was only reliably detected in plasma after treatment with reducing agent, ionizing linearly from 150 to 1200 fmol (on-target) with a mean CV of 7%. This method distinguishes itself from immunoaffinity resin-based approaches since it can be scaled to large milliliter quantities and it is compatible with plasma from all species tested.",

    "abstract": "Lysine acetylation is a reversible posttranslational modification of proteins and plays a key role in regulating gene expression. Technological limitations have so far prevented a global analysis of lysine acetylation's cellular roles. We used high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify 3600 lysine acetylation sites on 1750 proteins and quantified acetylation changes in response to the deacetylase inhibitors suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and MS-275. Lysine acetylation preferentially targets large macromolecular complexes involved in diverse cellular processes, such as chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, splicing, nuclear transport, and actin nucleation. Acetylation impaired phosphorylation-dependent interactions of 14-3-3 and regulated the yeast cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. Our data demonstrate that the regulatory scope of lysine acetylation is broad and comparable with that of other major posttranslational modifications.",

Nevertheless, only a handful of PTMs have been extensively investigated at the proteome level. Knowledge of protein substrates and their PTM sites is key to dissection of PTM-mediated cellular processes. The past several years have seen a tremendous progress in developing MS-based proteomics technologies for global PTM analysis, including numerous studies of yeast and other microbes. Modification-specific enrichment techniques combined with advanced MS/MS methods and computational data analysis have revealed a surprisingly large extent of PTMs in proteins, including multi-site, cooperative modifications in individual proteins. We review some of the current strategies employed for enrichment and detection of PTMs in modification-specific proteomics.",

    "abstract": "Several mass spectrometry-based assays have emerged for the quantitative profiling of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. Ideally, these methods should reveal the exact sites of tyrosine phosphorylation, be quantitative, and not be cost-prohibitive. The latter is often an issue as typically several milligrams of (stable isotope-labeled) starting protein material are required to enable the detection of low abundance phosphotyrosine peptides. Here, we adopted and refined a peptidecentric immunoaffinity purification approach for the quantitative analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation by combining it with a cost-effective stable isotope dimethyl labeling method. We were able to identify by mass spectrometry, using just two LC-MS/MS runs, more than 1100 unique non-redundant phosphopeptides in HeLa cells from about 4 mg of starting material without requiring any further affinity enrichment as close to 80% of the identified peptides were tyrosine phosphorylated peptides. Stable isotope dimethyl labeling could be incorporated prior to the immunoaffinity purification, even for the large quantities (mg) of peptide material used, enabling the quantification of differences in tyrosine phosphorylation upon pervanadate treatment or epidermal growth factor stimulation. Analysis of the epidermal growth factor-stimulated HeLa cells, a frequently used model system for tyrosine phosphorylation, resulted in the quantification of 73 regulated unique phosphotyrosine peptides. The quantitative data were found to be exceptionally consistent with the literature, evidencing that such a targeted quantitative phosphoproteomics approach can provide reproducible results. In general, the combination of immunoaffinity purification of tyrosine phosphorylated peptides with large scale stable isotope dimethyl labeling provides a cost-effective approach that can alleviate variation in sample preparation and analysis as samples can be combined early on. Using this approach, a rather complete qualitative and quantitative picture of tyrosine phosphorylation signaling events can be generated.",

The composition, optical activity, and proteolytic activity of this protein remain constant through seven successive crystallizations. No evidence for the presence of a mixture or of a solid solution is found in a study of the solubility of the protein in a series of different salt solutions, nor from the diffusion coefficient or from the rate of inactivation. These results indicate that the material is a pure substance or possibly a solid solution of two or more substances having nearly the same solubility in all the various solvents studied. It seems reasonable to conclude from these experiments that the possibility of a mixture must be limited to a mixture of proteins, so that the conclusion seems justified that pepsin itself is a protein.",

    "abstract": "Prior to embarking upon the purification of a protein, one should begin by considering what the protein is to be used for. In particular, how much of the protein is needed, what should be its state of purity, and must it be folded correctly and associated with various other peptides or cofactors. Using such criteria, an appropriate assay should be chosen and a procedure be planned taking into account the source of the protein, how it is to be extracted from the source, and what agents the protein ought to be exposed to or ultimately be stored in. One is often surprised at the time necessary to develop an appropriate protein purification procedure relative to the time required to clone a gene or to accumulate information with the purified protein. There are an overwhelming number of options for protein purification steps, so forethought is necessary to expedite the tedious job of developing the purification scheme, or to avoid having to redesign it upon attempting to use the protein. This chapter points out general considerations to be undertaken in designing, organizing, and executing the purification, while subsequent chapters of this volume supply more specific options and technical details.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry has quickly become an essential tool in molecular biology laboratories. Here, we describe the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline, a collection of software tools, to facilitate the analysis, exchange, and comparison of MS data. The pipeline is instrument-independent and supports most commonly used proteomics workflows, including quantitative applications such as ICAT, iTRAQ, and SILAC. Importantly, the pipeline uses open, standard data formats and calculates accurate estimates of sensitivity and error rates, thus allowing for meaningful data exchange. In this chapter, we will introduce the various components of the pipeline in the context of three typical proteomic use-case scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry is an important technique for analyzing proteins and other biomolecular compounds in biological samples. Each of the vendors of these mass spectrometers uses a different proprietary binary output file format, which has hindered data sharing and the development of open source software for downstream analysis. The solution has been to develop, with the full participation of academic researchers as well as software and hardware vendors, an open XML-based format for encoding mass spectrometer output files, and then to write software to use this format for archiving, sharing, and processing. This chapter presents the various components and information available for this format, mzML. In addition to the XML schema that defines the file structure, a controlled vocabulary provides clear terms and definitions for the spectral metadata, and a semantic validation rules mapping file allows the mzML semantic validator to insure that an mzML document complies with one of several levels of requirements. Complete documentation and example files insure that the format may be uniformly implemented. At the time of release, there already existed several implementations of the format and vendors have committed to supporting the format in their products.",

    "abstract": "The FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase plays an important role in normal hematopoietic development and leukemogenesis. Point mutations within the activation loop and in-frame tandem duplications of the juxtamembrane domain represent the most frequent molecular abnormalities observed in acute myeloid leukemia. Interestingly these gain-of-function mutations correlate with different clinical outcomes, suggesting that signals from constitutive FLT3 mutants activate different downstream targets. In principle, mass spectrometry offers a powerful means to quantify protein phosphorylation and identify signaling events associated with constitutively active kinases or other oncogenic events. However, regulation of individual phosphorylation sites presents a challenging case for proteomics studies whereby quantification is based on individual peptides rather than an average across different peptides derived from the same protein. Here we describe a robust experimental framework and associated error model for iTRAQ-based quantification on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer that relates variance of peptide ratios to mass spectral peak height and provides for assignment of p value, q value, and confidence interval to every peptide identification, all based on routine measurements, obviating the need for detailed characterization of individual ion peaks. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model is stable over time and can be applied in a manner directly analogous to ubiquitously used external mass calibration routines. Application of our error model to quantitative proteomics data for FLT3 signaling provides evidence that phosphorylation of tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 abrogates the transformative potential, but not overall kinase activity, of FLT3-D835Y in acute myeloid leukemia.",

While conventional purification methods such as dialysis, ultrafiltration or protein precipitation often lead to a marked loss of protein, SPE with small-sized particles is a powerful alternative. The implementation of particles with superparamagnetic cores facilitates the handling of those particles and allows the application of particles in the nanometer to low micrometer range. Due to the small diameters, magnetic particles are advantageous for increasing sensitivity when using subsequent MS analysis or gel electrophoresis. In the last years, different types of magnetic particles were developed for specific protein purification purposes followed by analysis or screening procedures using MS or SDS gel electrophoresis. In this review, the use of magnetic particles for different applications, such as, the extraction and analysis of DNA/RNA, peptides and proteins, is described.",

Here we examine the use of multiple proteases (trypsin, LysC, ArgC, AspN, and GluC) to improve both protein identification and characterization in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a data-dependent, decision tree-based algorithm to tailor MS(2) fragmentation method to peptide precursor, we identified 92 095 unique peptides (609 665 total) mapping to 3908 proteins at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR). These results were a significant improvement upon data from a single protease digest (trypsin) - 27 822 unique peptides corresponding to 3313 proteins. The additional 595 protein identifications were mainly from those at low abundances (i.e., < 1000 copies/cell); sequence coverage for these proteins was likewise improved nearly 3-fold. We demonstrate that large portions of the proteome are simply inaccessible following digestion with a single protease and that multiple proteases, rather than technical replicates, provide a direct route to increase both protein identifications and proteome sequence coverage.",

    "abstract": "Most proteins form macromolecular complexes to perform their biological functions. However, experimentally determined protein complex data, especially of those involving more than two protein partners, are relatively limited in the current state-of-the-art high-throughput experimental techniques. Nevertheless, many techniques (such as yeast-two-hybrid) have enabled systematic screening of pairwise protein-protein interactions en masse. Thus computational approaches for detecting protein complexes from protein interaction data are useful complements to the limited experimental methods. They can be used together with the experimental methods for mapping the interactions of proteins to understand how different proteins are organized into higher-level substructures to perform various cellular functions.",

DiLeu reagents serve as attractive alternatives for isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and tandem mass tags (TMTs) due to their synthetic simplicity, labeling efficiency, and improved fragmentation efficiency. DiLeu reagent resembles the general structure of a tandem mass tag in that it contains an amine reactive group (triazine ester) targeting the N-terminus and epsilon-amino group of the lysine side chain of a peptide, a balance group, and a reporter group. A mass shift of 145.1 Da is observed for each incorporated label. Intense a(1) reporter ions at m/z 115.1, 116.1, 117.1, and 118.1 are observed for all pooled samples upon MS(2). All labeling reagents are readily synthesized from commercially available chemicals with greatly reduced cost. Labels 117 and 118 can be synthesized in one step and labels 115 and 116 can be synthesized in two steps. Both DiLeu and iTRAQ reagents show comparable protein sequence coverage (approximately 43%) and quantitation accuracy (<15%) for tryptically digested protein samples. Furthermore, enhanced fragmentation of DiLeu labeling reagents offers greater confidence in protein identification and neuropeptide sequencing from complex neuroendocrine tissue extracts from a marine model organism, Callinectes sapidus.",

Various strategies for enrichment of phosphoproteins or phosphopeptides have been developed. Here, we developed a novel sequential phosphopeptide enrichment method, using magnetic iron oxide (Fe(3)O(4)) and titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) particles, to detect mono- and multi-phosphorylated peptides. In the first step, phosphopeptides were captured on Fe(3)O(4) particles. In a subsequent step, any residual phosphopeptides were captured on TiO(2) particles. The particles were eluted and rinsed to yield phosphopeptide-enriched fractions that were combined and analyzed using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The validity of this sequential Fe(3)O(4)/TiO(2) enrichment strategy was demonstrated by the successful enrichment of bovine alpha-casein phosphopeptides. We then applied the sequential Fe(3)O(4)/TiO(2) enrichment method to the analysis of phosphopeptides in L6 muscle cell lysates and successfully identified mono- and multi-phosphorylated peptides.",

    "abstract": "Glycopeptide enrichment is a prerequisite to enable structural characterization of protein glycosylation in glycoproteomics. Here we present an improved method for glycopeptide enrichment based on zwitter-ionic hydrophilic interaction chromatography solid phase extraction (ZIC-HILIC SPE) in a microcolumn format. The method involves TFA ion pairing (IP) to increase the hydrophilicity difference between glycopeptides and nonglycosylated peptides. Three mobile phases were investigated, i.e., 2% formic acid (defined as IP(2% FA) ZIC-HILIC SPE), 0.1% TFA and 1% TFA (defined as IP(0.1% TFA) and IP(1% TFA) ZIC-HILIC SPE) all containing 80% acetonitrile. Samples of increasing complexities, i.e., digests of single glycoproteins, a five-glycoprotein mixture, and depleted plasma, were used in the study. The presence of TFA in the mobile phase significantly improved the glycopeptide enrichment for all complexities, as evaluated by enhanced glycopeptide detection using MALDI-TOF MS and RP-LC-ESI-MS/MS, e.g., the glycopeptide ion signals were increased by up to 3.7-fold compared to IP(2% FA) conditions. The enhanced glycopeptide detection was promoted by a substantial depletion of nonglycosylated peptides, offering an almost complete isolation of IgG glycopeptides using a single SPE enrichment step and a reduction from 711 nonglycosylated peptides observed in the IP(2% FA) ZIC-HILIC SPE retained plasma fraction, to only 157 and 97 when 0.1% and 1% TFA was used in the mobile phase. In conclusion, this systematic study has shown that TFA-containing mobile phases increase glycopeptide enrichment efficiency considerably for a broad range of sample complexities when using ZIC-HILIC SPE.",

    "abstract": "Peptide labeling with isobaric tags has become a popular technique in quantitative shotgun proteomics. Using two different samples viz. a protein mixture and HeLa extracts, we show that three commercially available isobaric tags differ with regard to peptide identification rates: The number of identified proteins and peptides was largest with iTRAQ 4-plex, followed by TMT 6-plex, and smallest with iTRAQ 8-plex. In all experiments, we employed a previously described method where two scans were acquired for each precursor on an LTQ Orbitrap: A CID scan under standard settings for identification, and a HCD scan for quantification. The observed differences in identification rates were similar when data was searched with either Mascot or Sequest. We consider these findings to be the result of a combination of several factors, most notably prominent ions in CID spectra as a consequence of loss of fragments of the label tag from precursor ions. These fragment ions cannot be explained by current search engines and were observed to have a negative impact on peptide scores.",

    "abstract": "Immunoaffinity depletion with antibodies to the top 7 or top 14 high-abundance plasma proteins is used to enhance detection of lower abundance proteins in both shotgun and targeted proteomic analyses. We evaluated the effects of top 7/top 14 immunodepletion on the shotgun proteomic analysis of human plasma. Our goal was to evaluate the impact of immunodepletion on detection of proteins across detectable ranges of abundance. The depletion columns afforded highly repeatable and efficient plasma protein fractionation. Relatively few nontargeted proteins were captured by the depletion columns. Analyses of unfractionated and immunodepleted plasma by peptide isoelectric focusing (IEF), followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), demonstrated enrichment of nontargeted plasma proteins by an average of 4-fold, as assessed by MS/MS spectral counting. Either top 7 or top 14 immunodepletion resulted in a 25% increase in identified proteins compared to unfractionated plasma. Although 23 low-abundance (<10 ng mL(-1)) plasma proteins were detected, they accounted for only 5-6% of total protein identifications in immunodepleted plasma. In both unfractionated and immunodepleted plasma, the 50 most abundant plasma proteins accounted for 90% of cumulative spectral counts and precursor ion intensities, leaving little capacity to sample lower abundance proteins. Untargeted proteomic analyses using current LC-MS/MS platforms-even with immunodepletion-cannot be expected to efficiently discover low-abundance, disease-specific biomarkers in plasma.",

Peptides labeled with DiART were analyzed using an electrospray ionization (ESI)-based LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Our data showed that (2)H-associated isotope effects, such as partial loss of (2)H labels during tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and (2)H-related chromatographic shift, were either not observed or negligible. With the use of a hybrid collision-induced dissociation (CID)-higher energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) acquisition method, we were able to identify DiART-labeled peptides with high confidence and quantify them with high accuracy. Furthermore, we adopted a hybrid electron-transfer dissociation (ETD)-HCD acquisition protocol and developed a novel data analysis approach to measure phosphorylation of peptides. Our results showed DiART had excellent performance on LTQ-Orbitrap instruments and provided a cost-effective technique for large-scale quantitative proteomics measurements.",

    "abstract": "Plasma biomarkers studies are based on the differential expression of proteins between different treatment groups or between diseased and control populations. Most mass spectrometry-based methods of protein quantitation, however, are based on the detection and quantitation of peptides, not intact proteins. For peptide-based protein quantitation to be accurate, the digestion protocols used in proteomic analyses must be both efficient and reproducible. There have been very few studies, however, where plasma denaturation/digestion protocols have been compared using absolute quantitation methods. In this paper, 14 combinations of heat, solvent [acetonitrile, methanol, trifluoroethanol], chaotropic agents [guanidine hydrochloride, urea], and surfactants [sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium deoxycholate (DOC)] were compared with respect to their effectiveness in improving subsequent tryptic digestion. These digestion protocols were evaluated by quantitating the production of proteotypic tryptic peptides from 45 moderate- to high-abundance plasma proteins, using tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring mode, with a mixture of stable-isotope labeled analogues of these proteotypic peptides as internal standards. When the digestion efficiencies of these 14 methods were compared, we found that both of the surfactants (SDS and DOC) produced an increase in the overall yield of tryptic peptides from these 45 proteins, when compared to the more commonly used urea protocol. SDS, however, can be a serious interference for subsequent mass spectrometry. DOC, on the other hand, can be easily removed from the samples by acid precipitation. Examining the results of a reproducibility study, done with 5 replicate digestions, DOC and SDS with a 9 h digestion time produced the highest average digestion efficiencies (∼80%), with the highest average reproducibility (<5% error, defined as the relative deviation from the mean value). However, because of potential interferences resulting from the use of SDS, we recommend DOC with a 9 h digestion procedure as the optimum protocol.",

    "abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activate pathways mediated by serine-threonine kinases, such as the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)-Akt pathway, the Ras-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase) pathway, and the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)-p70 S6 pathway, that control important aspects of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. The Akt, RSK, and p70 S6 family of protein kinases transmits signals by phosphorylating substrates on an RxRxxS/T motif (R, arginine; S, serine; T, threonine; and x, any amino acid). We developed a large-scale proteomic approach to identify more than 300 substrates of this kinase family in cancer cell lines driven by the c-Met, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) RTKs. We identified a subset of proteins with RxRxxS/T sites for which phosphorylation was decreased by RTK inhibitors (RTKIs), as well as by inhibitors of the PI3K, mTOR, and MAPK pathways, and we determined the effects of small interfering RNA directed against these substrates on cell viability. Phosphorylation of the protein chaperone SGTA (small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alpha) at serine-305 was essential for PDGFRalpha stabilization and cell survival in PDGFRalpha-dependent cancer cells. Our approach provides a new view of RTK and Akt-RSK-S6 kinase signaling, revealing previously unidentified Akt-RSK-S6 kinase substrates that merit further consideration as targets for combination therapy with RTKIs.",

    "abstract": "Peptide fractionation is extremely important in proteomics approaches. Full proteome characterization is desired from complex organisms, and with growing interest in post-translational modifications an extended protein sequence coverage is required. Peptide fractionation techniques have the great challenge of feeding current mass spectrometers in a way in which these issues are met. Peptide fractionation can be divided into three simple components: the column characteristics; the mobile phase; and peptide properties (charge, polarity, hydrophobicity and size). The current challenges are in the combination of these three components to allow comprehensive proteomics studies to be improved.",

    "abstract": "The ability to understand the inner works of the cell requires methods for separation of intracellular membrane-enclosed compartments. Disruption of the plasma membrane (PM) by mechanical forces to investigate the content of the cell is common practice. Whether vesicles or membranes of different sources can fuse as a result is unclear. If such contamination occurs, conclusions based on these techniques should consider these. Utilizing an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane marker and a PM marker, we were able to detect the source of membranes following the breakup of cells using flow cytometry and immuno Electron Microscopy (immuno EM). Fractionation processes produced a small fraction of new membrane entities from two distinctively different origins generated during the initial disruption steps in a temperature independent manner, stressing that defining organelles or intrinsic fusion events based on such procedures and markers are valid when exceeding the small number of vesicles fused during the fractionation process.",

The technique, however, presents a number of challenges for large-scale use, including the diverse raw data file formats output by mass spectrometers, the large false positive rate among peptide assignments to MS/MS spectra, and the loss of connectivity between identified peptides and the sample proteins that gave rise to them. Here we describe the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline, a freely available open source software suite that provides uniform analysis of LC-MS/MS data from raw data to quantified sample proteins. In a straightforward manner, users can extract MS/MS information from raw data of many instrument formats, submit them to search engines for peptide identification, validate the results to remove false hits, combine together results of multiple search engines, infer sample proteins that gave rise to the identified peptides, and perform quantitation at the peptide and protein levels.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the implementation of various denaturants and their efficacy in bottom-up membrane proteomic methods using LC-MS analysis, microsomes isolated from tomato roots were treated with MS-compatible surfactants (RapiGest SF Surfactant from Waters and PPS Silent Surfactant from Protein Discovery), a chaotropic reagent (guanidine hydrochloride), and an organic solvent (methanol). Peptides were analyzed in triplicate sample and technical replicates by data-independent LC-MS(E) analysis. Overall, 2333 unique peptides matching to 662 unique proteins were detected with the order of denaturant method efficacy being RapiGest SF Surfactant, PPS Silent Surfactant, guanidine hydrochloride, and methanol. Using bioinformatic analysis, 103 proteins were determined to be integral membrane proteins. When normalizing the data as a percentage of the overall number of peptides and proteins identified for each method, the order for integral membrane protein identification efficacy was methanol, guanidine hydrochloride, RapiGest SF Surfactant, and PPS Silent Surfactant. Interestingly, only 8% of the proteins were identified in all four methods with the silent surfactants having the greatest overlap at 17%. GRAVY analysis at the protein and peptide level indicated that methanol and guanidine hydrochloride promoted detection of hydrophobic proteins and peptides, respectively; however, trypsin activity in the presence of each denaturant was determined as a major factor contributing to peptide identification by LC-MS(E) . These results reveal the complementary nature of each denaturant method, which can be used in an integrated approach to provide a more effective bottom-up analysis of membrane proteomes than can be achieved using only a single denaturant.",

    "abstract": "We used deep sequencing technology to profile the transcriptome, gene copy number, and CpG island methylation status simultaneously in eight commonly used breast cell lines to develop a model for how these genomic features are integrated in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative breast cancer. Total mRNA sequence, gene copy number, and genomic CpG island methylation were carried out using the Illumina Genome Analyzer. Sequences were mapped to the human genome to obtain digitized gene expression data, DNA copy number in reference to the non-tumor cell line (MCF10A), and methylation status of 21,570 CpG islands to identify differentially expressed genes that were correlated with methylation or copy number changes. These were evaluated in a dataset from 129 primary breast tumors. Gene expression in cell lines was dominated by ER-associated genes. ER+ and ER- cell lines formed two distinct, stable clusters, and 1,873 genes were differentially expressed in the two groups. Part of chromosome 8 was deleted in all ER- cells and part of chromosome 17 amplified in all ER+ cells. These loci encoded 30 genes that were overexpressed in ER+ cells; 9 of these genes were overexpressed in ER+ tumors. We identified 149 differentially expressed genes that exhibited differential methylation of one or more CpG islands within 5 kb of the 5' end of the gene and for which mRNA abundance was inversely correlated with CpG island methylation status. In primary tumors we identified 84 genes that appear to be robust components of the methylation signature that we identified in ER+ cell lines. Our analyses reveal a global pattern of differential CpG island methylation that contributes to the transcriptome landscape of ER+ and ER- breast cancer cells and tumors. The role of gene amplification/deletion appears to more modest, although several potentially significant genes appear to be regulated by copy number aberrations.",

Flexible receptor molecular docking approaches, especially those including backbone flexibility in receptors, are a challenge for available docking methods. A recently developed Local Move Monte Carlo (LMMC) based approach is introduced as a potential solution to flexible receptor docking problems.

    "abstract": "The combination of tandem mass spectrometry and sequence database searching is the method of choice for the identification of peptides and the mapping of proteomes. Over the last several years, the volume of data generated in proteomic studies has increased dramatically, which challenges the computational approaches previously developed for these data. Furthermore, a multitude of search engines have been developed that identify different, overlapping subsets of the sample peptides from a particular set of tandem mass spectrometry spectra. We present iProphet, the new addition to the widely used open-source suite of proteomic data analysis tools Trans-Proteomics Pipeline. Applied in tandem with PeptideProphet, it provides more accurate representation of the multilevel nature of shotgun proteomic data. iProphet combines the evidence from multiple identifications of the same peptide sequences across different spectra, experiments, precursor ion charge states, and modified states. It also allows accurate and effective integration of the results from multiple database search engines applied to the same data. The use of iProphet in the Trans-Proteomics Pipeline increases the number of correctly identified peptides at a constant false discovery rate as compared with both PeptideProphet and another state-of-the-art tool Percolator. As the main outcome, iProphet permits the calculation of accurate posterior probabilities and false discovery rate estimates at the level of sequence identical peptide identifications, which in turn leads to more accurate probability estimates at the protein level. Fully integrated with the Trans-Proteomics Pipeline, it supports all commonly used MS instruments, search engines, and computer platforms. The performance of iProphet is demonstrated on two publicly available data sets: data from a human whole cell lysate proteome profiling experiment representative of typical proteomic data sets, and from a set of Streptococcus pyogenes experiments more representative of organism-specific composite data sets.",

The purpose of this work was to review the options for the characterization of HILIC stationary phases and their applications for separations of polar compounds in complex matrices. The characteristics of the hydrophilic stationary phase may affect and in some cases limit the choices of mobile phase composition, ion strength or buffer pH value available, since mechanisms other than hydrophilic partitioning could potentially occur. Enhancing our understanding of retention behavior in HILIC increases the scope of possible applications of liquid chromatography. One interesting option may also be to use HILIC in orthogonal and/or two-dimensional separations. Bioapplications of HILIC systems are also presented.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin is a fundamentally important regulatory mechanism. However, proteome-wide analysis of endogenous ubiquitylation remains a challenging task, and almost always has relied on cells expressing affinity tagged ubiquitin. Here we combine single-step immunoenrichment of ubiquitylated peptides with peptide fractionation and high-resolution mass spectrometry to investigate endogenous ubiquitylation sites. We precisely map 11,054 endogenous putative ubiquitylation sites (diglycine-modified lysines) on 4,273 human proteins. The presented data set covers 67% of the known ubiquitylation sites and contains 10,254 novel sites on proteins with diverse cellular functions including cell signaling, receptor endocytosis, DNA replication, DNA damage repair, and cell cycle progression. Our method enables site-specific quantification of ubiquitylation in response to cellular perturbations and is applicable to any cell type or tissue. Global quantification of ubiquitylation in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 discovers sites that are involved in proteasomal degradation, and suggests a nonproteasomal function for almost half of all sites. Surprisingly, ubiquitylation of about 15% of sites decreased more than twofold within four hours of MG-132 treatment, showing that inhibition of proteasomal function can dramatically reduce ubiquitylation on many sites with non-proteasomal functions. Comparison of ubiquitylation sites with acetylation sites reveals an extensive overlap between the lysine residues targeted by these two modifications. However, the crosstalk between these two post-translational modifications is significantly less frequent on sites that show increased ubiquitylation upon proteasome inhibition. Taken together, we report the largest site-specific ubiquitylation dataset in human cells, and for the first time demonstrate proteome-wide, site-specific quantification of endogenous putative ubiquitylation sites.",

    "abstract": "Despite the diverse biological pathways known to be regulated by ubiquitylation, global identification of substrates that are targeted for ubiquitylation has remained a challenge. To globally characterize the human ubiquitin-modified proteome (ubiquitinome), we utilized a monoclonal antibody that recognizes diglycine (diGly)-containing isopeptides following trypsin digestion. We identify ~19,000 diGly-modified lysine residues within ~5000 proteins. Using quantitative proteomics we monitored temporal changes in diGly site abundance in response to both proteasomal and translational inhibition, indicating both a dependence on ongoing translation to observe alterations in site abundance and distinct dynamics of individual modified lysines in response to proteasome inhibition. Further, we demonstrate that quantitative diGly proteomics can be utilized to identify substrates for cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. Interrogation of the ubiquitinome allows for not only a quantitative assessment of alterations in protein homeostasis fidelity, but also identification of substrates for individual ubiquitin pathway enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) represent the largest E3 ubiquitin ligase family in eukaryotes, and the identification of their substrates is critical to understanding regulation of the proteome. Using genetic and pharmacologic Cullin inactivation coupled with genetic (GPS) and proteomic (QUAINT) assays, we have identified hundreds of proteins whose stabilities or ubiquitylation status are regulated by CRLs. Together, these approaches yielded many known CRL substrates as well as a multitude of previously unknown putative substrates. We demonstrate that one substrate, NUSAP1, is an SCF(Cyclin F) substrate during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and is also degraded in response to DNA damage. This collection of regulated substrates is highly enriched for nodes in protein interaction networks, representing critical connections between regulatory pathways. This demonstrates the broad role of CRL ubiquitylation in all aspects of cellular biology and provides a set of proteins likely to be key indicators of cellular physiology.",

    "abstract": "Ammonium sulfate precipitation (ASP) was explored as a method for depleting some highly abundant proteins from blood plasma, in order to reduce the dynamic range of protein concentration and to improve the detection of low abundance proteins by 2D-PAGE. 40% ammonium sulfate saturation was chosen since it allowed depleting 39% albumin and 82% α-1-antitrypsin. ASP-depletion showed high reproducibility in 2D-PAGE analysis (4.2% variation in relative abundance of albumin), similar to that offered by commercial affinity-depletion columns. Besides, it allowed detecting 59 spots per gel, very close to the number of spots detected in immuno-affinity-depleted plasma. Thus, ASP at 40% saturation is a reliable depletion method that may help in proteomic analysis of blood plasma. Finally, ASP-depletion seems to be complementary to hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC)-depletion, and therefore an ASP-step followed by a HIC-step could probably deplete the most highly abundant plasma proteins, thus improving the detection of low abundance proteins by 2D-PAGE.",

    "abstract": "Rapid changes of protein phosphorylation play a crucial role in the regulation of many cellular processes. Being post-translationally modified, phosphoproteins are often present in quite low abundance and tend to co-exist with their unphosphorylated isoform within the cell. To make their identification more practicable, the use of enrichment protocols is often required. The enrichment strategies can be performed either at the level of phosphoproteins or at the level of phosphopeptides. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. Most enriching strategies are based on chemical modifications, affinity chromatography to capture peptides and proteins containing negatively charged phosphate groups onto a positively charged matrix, or immunoprecipitation by phospho-specific antibodies.In this article, the most up-to-date enrichment techniques are discussed, taking into account their optimization, and highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, these methods are compared to each other, revealing their complementary nature in providing comprehensive coverage of the phosphoproteome.",

While the first generation of genome projects focused on well-studied model organisms, many of today's projects involve exotic organisms whose genomes are largely terra incognita. This complicates their annotation, because unlike first-generation projects, there are no pre-existing 'gold-standard' gene-models with which to train gene-finders. Improvements in genome assembly and the wide availability of mRNA-seq data are also creating opportunities to update and re-annotate previously published genome annotations. Today's genome projects are thus in need of new genome annotation tools that can meet the challenges and opportunities presented by second-generation sequencing technologies.",

    "abstract": "Glycosylation affects many essential T cell processes and is intrinsically controlled throughout the lifetime of a T cell. CD43 and CD45 are the two most abundant glycoproteins on the T cell surface and are decorated with O- and N-glycans. Global T cell glycosylation and specific glycosylation of CD43 and CD45 are modulated during thymocyte development and T cell activation; T cells control the type and abundance of glycans decorating CD43 and CD45 by regulating expression of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases. Additionally, T cells regulate glycosylation of CD45 by expressing alternatively spliced isoforms of CD45 that have different glycan attachment sites. The glycophenotype of CD43 and CD45 on T cells influences how T cells interact with the extracellular environment, including how T cells interact with endogenous lectins. This review focuses on changes in glycosylation of CD43 and CD45 occurring throughout T cell development and activation and the role that glycosylation plays in regulating T cell processes, such as migration, T cell receptor signaling, and apoptosis.",

The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences.

    "abstract": "Pulsed Q collision-induced dissociation (PQD) was developed in part to facilitate detection of low-mass reporter ions using labeling reagents (e.g. iTRAQ) on LTQ platforms. It has generally been recognized that the scan speed and sensitivity of an LTQ are superior than those of an Orbitrap using the higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). However, the use of PQD in quantitative proteomics is limited, primarily due to the meager reproducibility of reporter ion ratios. Optimizations of PQD for iTRAQ quantification using LTQ have been reported, but a universally applicable strategy for quantifying the less abundant proteins has not been fully established. Adjustments of the AGC target, μscan, or scan speed offer only incremental improvements in reproducibility. From our experience, however, satisfactory coefficients of variation (CVs) of reporter ion ratios were difficult to achieve using the discovery-based approach. As an alternative, we implemented a target-based approach that obviates data dependency to allow repetitive data acquisitions across chromatographic peaks. Such a strategy generates enough data points for more reliable quantification. Using cAMP treatment in S49 cell lysates and this target-based approach, we were able to validate differentially expressed proteins, which were initially identified as potential candidates using the discovery-based PQD. The target-based strategy also yielded results comparable to those obtained from HCD in an Orbitrap. Our findings should aid LTQ users who desire to explore iTRAQ quantitative proteomics but have limited access to the more costly Orbitrap or other instruments.",

    "abstract": "Isobaric tags have broad applications in both basic and translational research, as demonstrated by the widely used isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). Recent results from large-scale quantitative proteomics projects, however, indicate that protein quantification by iTRAQ is often biased in complex biological samples. Here, we report the application of another isobaric tag, deuterium isobaric amine reactive tag (DiART), for quantifying the proteome of Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (T. tengcongensis), a thermophilic bacterium first discovered in China. We compared the performance of DiART with iTRAQ from several different aspects, including their fragmentation mechanisms, the number of identified proteins, and the accuracy of quantification. Our results revealed that, as compared with iTRAQ, DiART yielded significantly stronger reporter ions, which did not reduce the number of identifiable peptides, but improved the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for quantification. Remarkably, we found that, under identical chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS) conditions, DiART exhibited less reporter ions ratio compression than iTRAQ, probably due to more reporter ions with higher intensities produced by DiART labeling. Taken together, we demonstrate that DiART is a valuable alternative of iTRAQ with enhanced performance for quantitative proteomics.",

    "abstract": "N-Linked protein glycosylation is one of the most prevalent post-translational modifications and is involved in essential cellular functions such as cell-cell interactions and cellular recognition as well as in chronic diseases. In this study, we explored stable isotope labeled carbonyl-reactive tandem mass tags (glyco-TMTs) as a novel approach for the quantification of N-linked glycans. Glyco-TMTs bearing hydrazide- and aminooxy-functionalized groups were compared for glycan reducing end derivatization efficiency and quantification merits. Aminooxy TMTs outperform the hydrazide reagents in terms of labeling efficiency (>95% vs 65% at 0.1 μM) and mass spectrometry based quantification using heavy/light-TMT labeled glycans enabled accurate quantification in MS1 spectra (CV < 15%) over a broad dynamic range (up to 1:40). In contrast, isobaric TMT labeling with quantification of reporter ions in tandem mass spectra suffered from severe ratio compression already at low sample ratios. To demonstrate the practical utility of the developed approach, we characterized the global N-linked glycosylation profiles of the isogenic human colon carcinoma cell lines SW480 (primary tumor) and SW620 (metastatic tumor). The data revealed significant down-regulation of high-mannose glycans in the metastatic cell line.",

Yet, the time, effort, and expertise required to achieve reasonable protein coverage and reliable quantification have limited the broad application of this technology. To fully leverage mass spectrometry for the elucidation of biological systems requires sufficient throughput to monitor dynamic changes across conditions and to enable replicate analysis to provide statistical power. We report a straightforward approach to increase the multiplexing capacity of quantitative mass spectrometry, which provides a platform for the analysis of cellular signaling pathways. Using triplex metabolic labeling and six-plex isobaric tags, we monitored changes in protein abundance from 18 samples simultaneously, performing biological triplicates of a six-point time course of rapamycin-stimulated yeast. The data set provides temporal abundance profiles for thousands of yeast proteins, highlighting the complex cellular roles of the TOR (target of rapamycin) pathway.",

High-pH reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), followed by fraction concatenation, affords better peptide analysis than conventional strong cation-exchange chromatography applied for 2D proteomic analysis. For example, concatenated high-pH RPLC increased identification of peptides (by 1.8-fold) and proteins (by 1.6-fold) in shotgun proteomics analyses of a digested human protein sample. Additional advantages of high-pH RPLC with fraction concatenation include improved protein sequence coverage, simplified sample processing and reduced sample losses, making this an attractive alternative to strong cation-exchange chromatography in conjunction with second-dimension low-pH RPLC for 2D proteomics analyses.",

    "abstract": "Methods for isobaric tagging of peptides, iTRAQ or TMT, are commonly used platforms in mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics. These two methods are very often used to quantitate proteins in complex samples, e.g., serum/plasma or CSF supporting biomarker discovery studies. The success of these studies depends on multiple factors, including the accuracy of ratios of reporter ions reflecting quantitative changes of proteins. Because reporter ions are generated during peptide fragmentation, the differences of chemical structure of iTRAQ balance groups may have an effect on how efficiently these groups are fragmented and thus how differences in protein expression will be measured. Because 4-plex and 8-plex iTRAQ reagents do have different structures of balanced groups, it has been postulated that indeed differences in protein identification and quantitation exist between these two reagents. In this study we controlled the ratios of tagged samples and compared quantitation of proteins using 4-plex versus 8-plex reagents in the context of a highly complex sample of human plasma using ABSciex 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer and ProteinPilot 4.0 software. We observed that 8-plex tagging provides more consistent ratios than 4-plex without compromising protein identification, thus allowing investigation of eight experimental conditions in one analytical experiment.",

Eluting peptides were ionized by online electrospray and sequenced by both CID and ETD using data-dependent MS/MS. Statistically significant improvements in peptide identifications were observed with DMSO co-solvent. In order to understand this observation, we assessed the effects of supercharging reagents on the chromatographic separation and the electrospray quality. The increase in identifications was not due to supercharging, which was greater for the 0.1%m-NBA co-solvent and not observed for the 5.0% DMSO co-solvent. The improved MS/MS efficiency using the DMSO modified mobile phase appeared to result from charge state coalescence.",

We describe here a strategy for high-throughput sample preparation for the relative quantitation of N-glycan patterns of human plasma glycoproteins. To this end, efficient glycan release is combined with a robust labeling step. Sample purification is achieved using solid phase extraction with a hydrophilic interaction chromatography stationary phase, which allows the separation of the labeled glycans from excess label, proteins, and matrix constituents such as salts and lipids. We show that the obtained labeled glycan sample solution is directly compatible with a number of downstream analytical techniques such as hydrophilic interaction and reverse-phase chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. High throughput is achieved by conducting all sample preparation steps in the 96-well format. The robustness and repeatability of the sample preparation strategy is evaluated.",

    "abstract": "The complete and specific proteolytic cleavage of protein samples into peptides is crucial for the success of every shotgun LC-MS/MS experiment. In particular, popular peptide-based label-free and targeted mass spectrometry approaches rely on efficient generation of fully cleaved peptides to ensure accurate and sensitive protein quantification. In contrast to previous studies, we globally and quantitatively assessed the efficiency of different digestion strategies using a yeast cell lysate, label-free quantification, and statistical analysis. Digestion conditions include double tryptic, surfactant-assisted, and tandem-combinatorial Lys-C/trypsin digestion. In comparison to tryptic digests, Lys-C/trypsin digests were found most efficient to yield fully cleaved peptides while reducing the abundance of miscleaved peptides. Subsequent sequence context analysis revealed improved digestion performances of Lys-C/trypsin for miscleaved sequence stretches flanked by charged basic and particulary acidic residues. Furthermore, targeted MS analysis demonstrated a more comprehensive protein cleavage only after Lys-C/trypsin digestion, resulting in a more accurrate absolute protein quantification and extending the number of peptides suitable for SRM assay development. Therefore, we conclude that a serial Lys-C/trypsin digestion is highly attractive for most applications in quantitative MS-based proteomics building on in-solution digestion schemes.",

    "abstract": "Redox-proteomics involves the large scale analysis of oxidative protein post-translational modifications. In particular, cysteine residues have become the subject of intensifying research interest because of their redox-reactive thiol side chain. Certain reactive cysteine residues can function as redox-switches, which sense changes in the local redox-environment by flipping between the reduced and oxidized state. Depending on the reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, cysteine residues can receive one of several oxidative modifications, each with the potential to confer a functional effect. Modification of these redox-switches has been found to play an important role in oxidative-signaling in the cardiovascular system and elsewhere. Due to the labile and dynamic nature of these modifications, several targeted approaches have been developed to enrich, identify and characterize the status of these critical residues. Here, we review the various proteomic strategies and limitations for the large scale analysis of the different oxidative cysteine modifications.",

    "abstract": "Calorie restriction (CR) extends life span in diverse species. Mitochondria play a key role in CR adaptation; however, the molecular details remain elusive. We developed and applied a quantitative mass spectrometry method to probe the liver mitochondrial acetyl-proteome during CR versus control diet in mice that were wild-type or lacked the protein deacetylase SIRT3. Quantification of 3,285 acetylation sites-2,193 from mitochondrial proteins-rendered a comprehensive atlas of the acetyl-proteome and enabled global site-specific, relative acetyl occupancy measurements between all four experimental conditions. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses provided additional support for the effects of specific acetylation on mitochondrial protein function. Our results (1) reveal widespread reprogramming of mitochondrial protein acetylation in response to CR and SIRT3, (2) identify three biochemically distinct classes of acetylation sites, and (3) provide evidence that SIRT3 is a prominent regulator in CR adaptation by coordinately deacetylating proteins involved in diverse pathways of metabolism and mitochondrial maintenance.",

A battery of disorder predictors and their variants, VL-XT, VSL2b, PrDOS, PV2, Espritz and IUPred, were run on all protein sequences from 1765 complete proteomes (to be updated as more genomes are completed). Integrated with these results are all of the predicted (mostly structured) SCOP domains using the SUPERFAMILY predictor. These disorder/structure annotations together enable comparison of the disorder predictors with each other and examination of the overlap between disordered predictions and SCOP domains on a large scale. D(2)P(2) will increase our understanding of the interplay between disorder and structure, the genomic distribution of disorder, and its evolutionary history. The parsed data are made available in a unified format for download as flat files or SQL tables either by genome, by predictor, or for the complete set. An interactive website provides a graphical view of each protein annotated with the SCOP domains and disordered regions from all predictors overlaid (or shown as a consensus). There are statistics and tools for browsing and comparing genomes and their disorder within the context of their position on the tree of life.",

    "abstract": "The hydrophobic nature of most membrane proteins severely complicates their extraction, proteolysis and identification. Although detergents can be used to enhance the solubility of the membrane proteins, it is often difficult for a detergent not only to have a strong ability to extract membrane proteins, but also to be compatible with the subsequent proteolysis and mass spectrometric analysis. In this study, we made evaluation on a novel application of sodium laurate (SL) to the shotgun analysis of membrane proteomes. SL was found not only to lyse the membranes and solubilize membrane proteins as efficiently as SDS, but also to be well compatible with trypsin and chymotrypsin. Furthermore, SL could be efficiently removed by phase transfer method from samples after acidification, thus ensuring not to interfere with the subsequent CapLC-MS/MS analysis of the proteolytic peptides of proteins. When SL was applied to assist the digestion and identification of a standard protein mixture containing bacteriorhodoposin and the proteins in rat liver plasma membrane-enriched fractions, it was found that, compared with other two representative enzyme- and MS-compatible detergents RapiGest SF (RGS) and sodium deoxycholate (SDC), SL exhibited obvious superiority in the identification of membrane proteins particularly those with high hydrophobicity and/or multiple transmembrane domains.",

    "abstract": "The majority of mass spectrometry-based protein quantification studies uses peptide-centric analytical methods and thus strongly relies on efficient and unbiased protein digestion protocols for sample preparation. We present a novel objective approach to assess protein digestion efficiency using a combination of qualitative and quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem MS methods and statistical data analysis. In contrast to previous studies we employed both standard qualitative as well as data-independent quantitative workflows to systematically assess trypsin digestion efficiency and bias using mitochondrial protein fractions. We evaluated nine trypsin-based digestion protocols, based on standard in-solution or on spin filter-aided digestion, including new optimized protocols. We investigated various reagents for protein solubilization and denaturation (dodecyl sulfate, deoxycholate, urea), several trypsin digestion conditions (buffer, RapiGest, deoxycholate, urea), and two methods for removal of detergents before analysis of peptides (acid precipitation or phase separation with ethyl acetate). Our data-independent quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem MS workflow quantified over 3700 distinct peptides with 96% completeness between all protocols and replicates, with an average 40% protein sequence coverage and an average of 11 peptides identified per protein. Systematic quantitative and statistical analysis of physicochemical parameters demonstrated that deoxycholate-assisted in-solution digestion combined with phase transfer allows for efficient, unbiased generation and recovery of peptides from all protein classes, including membrane proteins. This deoxycholate-assisted protocol was also optimal for spin filter-aided digestions as compared with existing methods.",

Optimization of target engagement by drugs in cells is often challenging, because drug binding cannot be monitored inside cells. We have developed a method for evaluating drug binding to target proteins in cells and tissue samples. This cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) is based on the biophysical principle of ligand-induced thermal stabilization of target proteins. Using this assay, we validated drug binding for a set of important clinical targets and monitored processes of drug transport and activation, off-target effects and drug resistance in cancer cell lines, as well as drug distribution in tissues. CETSA is likely to become a valuable tool for the validation and optimization of drug target engagement.",

    "abstract": "Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) is a widely used approach for the identification of protein-protein interactions. However, for any given protein of interest, determining which of the identified polypeptides represent bona fide interactors versus those that are background contaminants (for example, proteins that interact with the solid-phase support, affinity reagent or epitope tag) is a challenging task. The standard approach is to identify nonspecific interactions using one or more negative-control purifications, but many small-scale AP-MS studies do not capture a complete, accurate background protein set when available controls are limited. Fortunately, negative controls are largely bait independent. Hence, aggregating negative controls from multiple AP-MS studies can increase coverage and improve the characterization of background associated with a given experimental protocol.

    "abstract": "Recently, we reported a novel proteomics quantitation scheme termed \"combined precursor isotopic labeling and isobaric tagging (cPILOT)\" that allows for the identification and quantitation of nitrated peptides in as many as 12-16 samples in a single experiment. cPILOT offers enhanced multiplexing and posttranslational modification specificity, however excludes global quantitation for all peptides present in a mixture and underestimates reporter ion ratios similar to other isobaric tagging methods due to precursor co-isolation. Here, we present a novel chemical workflow for cPILOT that can be used for global tagging of all peptides in a mixture. Specifically, through low pH precursor dimethylation of tryptic or LysC peptides followed by high pH tandem mass tags, the same reporter ion can be used twice in a single experiment. Also, to improve triple-stage mass spectrometry (MS(3) ) data acquisition, a selective MS(3) method that focuses on product selection of the y1 fragment of lysine-terminated peptides is incorporated into the workflow. This novel cPILOT workflow has potential for global peptide quantitation that could lead to enhanced sample multiplexing and increase the number of quantifiable spectra obtained from MS(3) acquisition methods.",

    "abstract": "Protein methylation is a common posttranslational modification that mostly occurs on arginine and lysine residues. Arginine methylation has been reported to regulate RNA processing, gene transcription, DNA damage repair, protein translocation, and signal transduction. Lysine methylation is best known to regulate histone function and is involved in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. To better study protein methylation, we have developed highly specific antibodies against monomethyl arginine; asymmetric dimethyl arginine; and monomethyl, dimethyl, and trimethyl lysine motifs. These antibodies were used to perform immunoaffinity purification of methyl peptides followed by LC-MS/MS analysis to identify and quantify arginine and lysine methylation sites in several model studies. Overall, we identified over 1000 arginine methylation sites in human cell line and mouse tissues, and ∼160 lysine methylation sites in human cell line HCT116. The number of methylation sites identified in this study exceeds those found in the literature to date. Detailed analysis of arginine-methylated proteins observed in mouse brain compared with those found in mouse embryo shows a tissue-specific distribution of arginine methylation, and extends the types of proteins that are known to be arginine methylated to include many new protein types. Many arginine-methylated proteins that we identified from the brain, including receptors, ion channels, transporters, and vesicle proteins, are involved in synaptic transmission, whereas the most abundant methylated proteins identified from mouse embryo are transcriptional regulators and RNA processing proteins.",

Using DiART tagged custom mixtures of two phosphorylated peptides from alpha casein and their non-phosphorylated counterparts, we demonstrate the compatibility of DiART with TiO2 affinity purification of phosphorylated peptides. Comparison of theoretical vs. experimental reporter ion ratios reveals accurate quantification of phosphorylated peptides over a dynamic range of more than 15-fold. Using DiART labelling and TiO2 enrichment (DiART-TiO2) with large quantities of proteins (8 mg) from the cell lysate of model fungus Aspergillus nidulans, we quantified 744 unique phosphopeptides. Overlap of median values of TiO2 enriched phosphopeptides with theoretical values indicates accurate trends. Altogether these findings confirm the feasibility of performing quantitative phosphoproteomic experiments in a cost-effective manner using isobaric tagging reagents, DiART.",

    "abstract": "The goal of pathway analysis is to identify the pathways significantly impacted in a given phenotype. Many current methods are based on algorithms that consider pathways as simple gene lists, dramatically under-utilizing the knowledge that such pathways are meant to capture. During the past few years, a plethora of methods claiming to incorporate various aspects of the pathway topology have been proposed. These topology-based methods, sometimes referred to as \"third generation,\" have the potential to better model the phenomena described by pathways. Although there is now a large variety of approaches used for this purpose, no review is currently available to offer guidance for potential users and developers. This review covers 22 such topology-based pathway analysis methods published in the last decade. We compare these methods based on: type of pathways analyzed (e.g., signaling or metabolic), input (subset of genes, all genes, fold changes, gene p-values, etc.), mathematical models, pathway scoring approaches, output (one or more pathway scores, p-values, etc.) and implementation (web-based, standalone, etc.). We identify and discuss challenges, arising both in methodology and in pathway representation, including inconsistent terminology, different data formats, lack of meaningful benchmarks, and the lack of tissue and condition specificity.",

    "abstract": "Urea solution is one of the most commonly employed protein denaturants for protease digestion in proteomic studies. However, it has long been recognized that urea solution can cause carbamylation at the N termini of proteins/peptides and at the side chain amino groups of lysine and arginine residues. Protein/peptide carbamylation blocks protease digestion and affects protein identification and quantification in mass spectrometry analysis by blocking peptide amino groups from isotopic/isobaric labeling and changing peptide charge states, retention times, and masses. In addition, protein carbamylation during sample preparation makes it difficult to study in vivo protein carbamylation. In this study, we compared the peptide carbamylation in urea solutions of different buffers and found that ammonium-containing buffers were the most effective buffers to inhibit protein carbamylation in urea solution. The possible mechanism of carbamylation inhibition by ammonium-containing buffers is discussed, and a revised procedure for the protease digestion of proteins in urea and ammonium-containing buffers was developed to facilitate its application in proteomic research.",

    "abstract": "The structural characterization of proteins and peptides isolated in minute quantities requires the most efficient use of available sample. A mass spectrometer data system was programmed to continuously evaluate incoming liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry data against a user-defined array of information. The resulting conclusions were used to automatically set and modify acquisition parameters in real time to collect collision-induced dissociation spectra for selected ions (tandem mass spectrometry). This approach has provided a mechanism to target specific subsets of masses in a complex mixture and/or to discriminate selectively against masses that are known or not of interest. Masses of contaminants or peptide masses derived from known proteins can be automatically recorded and removed from further consideration for collision-induced dissociation analysis. Once recorded, these \"libraries\" of masses can be used across multiple analyses. This technique directs the mass spectrometer data system to focus on the analysis of masses significant to the user, even if their signal intensities are well below the intensities of contaminating masses. When combined with a database search program to correlate tandem mass spectra to known protein sequences, the identity of the protein can be established unequivocally by using less than 100 fmol of sample.",

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into a variety of functional somatic cells; these cells hold a great promise for the advancement of biomedical research and clinical therapy. The mechanisms underlying cellular pluripotency in human cells have been extensively explored in the past decade. In addition to the vast amount of knowledge obtained from the genetic and transcriptional research in hPSCs, there is a rapidly growing interest in the stem cell biology field to examine pluripotency at the protein and PTM level. This review addresses recent progress toward understanding the role of PTMs (glycosylation, phosphorylation, acetylation and methylation) in the regulation of cellular pluripotency.",

    "abstract": "A method to correlate the uninterpreted tandem mass spectra of peptides produced under low energy (10-50 eV) collision conditions with amino acid sequences in the Genpept database has been developed. In this method the protein database is searched to identify linear amino acid sequences within a mass tolerance of ±1 u of the precursor ion molecular weight A cross-correlation function is then used to provide a measurement of similarity between the mass-to-charge ratios for the fragment ions predicted from amino acid sequences obtained from the database and the fragment ions observed in the tandem mass spectrum. In general, a difference greater than 0.1 between the normalized cross-correlation functions of the first- and second-ranked search results indicates a successful match between sequence and spectrum. Searches of species-specific protein databases with tandem mass spectra acquired from peptides obtained from the enzymatically digested total proteins of E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells allowed matching of the spectra to amino acid sequences within proteins of these organisms. The approach described in this manuscript provides a convenient method to interpret tandem mass spectra with known sequences in a protein database.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative and qualitative protein characteristics are regulated at genomic, transcriptomic, and posttranscriptional levels. Here, we integrated in-depth transcriptome and proteome analyses of liver tissues from two rat strains to unravel the interactions within and between these layers. We obtained peptide evidence for 26,463 rat liver proteins. We validated 1,195 gene predictions, 83 splice events, 126 proteins with nonsynonymous variants, and 20 isoforms with nonsynonymous RNA editing. Quantitative RNA sequencing and proteomics data correlate highly between strains but poorly among each other, indicating extensive nongenetic regulation. Our multilevel analysis identified a genomic variant in the promoter of the most differentially expressed gene Cyp17a1, a previously reported top hit in genome-wide association studies for human hypertension, as a potential contributor to the hypertension phenotype in SHR rats. These results demonstrate the power of and need for integrative analysis for understanding genetic control of molecular dynamics and phenotypic diversity in a system-wide manner.",

    "abstract": "Bottom-up proteomics largely relies on tryptic peptides for protein identification and quantification. Tryptic digestion often provides limited coverage of protein sequence because of issues such as peptide length, ionization efficiency, and post-translational modification colocalization. Unfortunately, a region of interest in a protein, for example, because of proximity to an active site or the presence of important post-translational modifications, may not be covered by tryptic peptides. Detection limits, quantification accuracy, and isoform differentiation can also be improved with greater sequence coverage. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) would also greatly benefit from being able to identify additional targetable sequences. In an attempt to improve protein sequence coverage and to target regions of proteins that do not generate useful tryptic peptides, we deployed a multiprotease strategy on the HeLa proteome. First, we used seven commercially available enzymes in single, double, and triple enzyme combinations. A total of 48 digests were performed. 5223 proteins were detected by analyzing the unfractionated cell lysate digest directly; with 42% mean sequence coverage. Additional strong-anion exchange fractionation of the most complementary digests permitted identification of over 3000 more proteins, with improved mean sequence coverage. We then constructed a web application (https://proteomics.swmed.edu/confetti) that allows the community to examine a target protein or protein isoform in order to discover the enzyme or combination of enzymes that would yield peptides spanning a certain region of interest in the sequence. Finally, we examined the use of nontryptic digests for SRM. From our strong-anion exchange fractionation data, we were able to identify three or more proteotypic SRM candidates within a single digest for 6056 genes. Surprisingly, in 25% of these cases the digest producing the most observable proteotypic peptides was neither trypsin nor Lys-C. SRM analysis of Asp-N versus tryptic peptides for eight proteins determined that Asp-N yielded higher signal in five of eight cases.",

    "abstract": "Protein G (also designated Fc receptor type III) is the IgG-binding protein of group C and G streptococci. Protein G has also been shown to bind human serum albumin but at a site that is structurally separated from the IgG-binding region. From the known gene sequence of protein G, two synthetic oligonucleotides were constructed for use as probes in DNA-hybridization experiments to study the structure and distribution of the albumin- and IgG-binding regions in bacterial strains belonging to different species. Thus, one of the probes corresponded to repeats within the IgG-binding region (I) and the other corresponded to repeats in the albumin-binding encoding region (II). Probe I showed strong hybridization to DNA isolated from 31 human group C and G strains, whereas hybridization to probe II was variable. With the three restriction endonucleases used, three restriction patterns were found in Southern blot experiments. No fundamental difference could be detected in hybridization experiments, either between strains of group C and G streptococci, or between isolates of different clinical origin. No hybridization to DNA from other bacterial species was found.",

Here we present a mass-spectrometry-based draft of the human proteome and a public, high-performance, in-memory database for real-time analysis of terabytes of big data, called ProteomicsDB. The information assembled from human tissues, cell lines and body fluids enabled estimation of the size of the protein-coding genome, and identified organ-specific proteins and a large number of translated lincRNAs (long intergenic non-coding RNAs). Analysis of messenger RNA and protein-expression profiles of human tissues revealed conserved control of protein abundance, and integration of drug-sensitivity data enabled the identification of proteins predicting resistance or sensitivity. The proteome profiles also hold considerable promise for analysing the composition and stoichiometry of protein complexes. ProteomicsDB thus enables navigation of proteomes, provides biological insight and fosters the development of proteomic technology.",

Advances in analytical technologies and strategies, in particular the contributions of high-resolution mass spectrometers, efficient enrichments of phosphopeptides, and fast data acquisition and annotation, have catalyzed dramatic expansion of signaling landscapes in multiple systems during the past decade. While phosphoproteomics is an essential inquiry to map high-resolution signaling networks and to find relevant events among the apparently ubiquitous and widespread modifications of proteome, it presents tremendous challenges in separation sciences to translate it from discovery to clinical practice. In this mini-review, we summarize the analytical tools currently utilized for phosphoproteomic analysis (with focus on MS), progresses made on deciphering clinically relevant kinase-substrate networks, MS uses for biomarker discovery and validation, and the potential of phosphoproteomics for disease diagnostics and personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "S-Nitrosylation is a redox-based protein post-translational modification in response to nitric oxide signaling and is involved in a wide range of biological processes. Detection and quantification of protein S-nitrosylation have been challenging tasks due to instability and low abundance of the modification. Many studies have used mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods with different thiol-reactive reagents to label and identify proteins with S-nitrosylated cysteine (SNO-Cys). In this study, we developed a novel iodoTMT switch assay (ISA) using an isobaric set of thiol-reactive iodoTMTsixplex reagents to specifically detect and quantify protein S-nitrosylation. Irreversible labeling of SNO-Cys with the iodoTMTsixplex reagents enables immune-affinity detection of S-nitrosylated proteins, enrichment of iodoTMT-labeled peptides by anti-TMT resin, and importantly, unambiguous modification site-mapping and multiplex quantification by liquid chromatography-tandem MS. Additionally, we significantly improved anti-TMT peptide enrichment efficiency by competitive elution. Using ISA, we identified a set of SNO-Cys sites responding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in murine BV-2 microglial cells and revealed effects of S-allyl cysteine from garlic on LPS-induced protein S-nitrosylation in antioxidative signaling and mitochondrial metabolic pathways. ISA proved to be an effective proteomic approach for quantitative analysis of S-nitrosylation in complex samples and will facilitate the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of nitrosative stress in disease.",

    "abstract": "Disulfide bond identification is important for a detailed understanding of protein structures, which directly affect their biological functions. Here we describe an integrated workflow for the fast and accurate identification of authentic protein disulfide bridges. This novel workflow incorporates acidic proteolytic digestion using pepsin to eliminate undesirable disulfide reshuffling during sample preparation and a novel search engine, SlinkS, to directly identify disulfide-bridged peptides isolated via electron transfer higher energy dissociation (EThcD). In EThcD fragmentation of disulfide-bridged peptides, electron transfer dissociation preferentially leads to the cleavage of the S-S bonds, generating two intense disulfide-cleaved peptides as primary fragment ions. Subsequently, higher energy collision dissociation primarily targets unreacted and charge-reduced precursor ions, inducing peptide backbone fragmentation. SlinkS is able to provide the accurate monoisotopic precursor masses of the two disulfide-cleaved peptides and the sequence of each linked peptide by matching the remaining EThcD product ions against a linear peptide database. The workflow was validated using a protein mixture containing six proteins rich in natural disulfide bridges. Using this pepsin-based workflow, we were able to efficiently and confidently identify a total of 31 unique Cys-Cys bonds (out of 43 disulfide bridges present), with no disulfide reshuffling products detected. Pepsin digestion not only outperformed trypsin digestion in terms of the number of detected authentic Cys-Cys bonds, but, more important, prevented the formation of artificially reshuffled disulfide bridges due to protein digestion under neutral pH. Our new workflow therefore provides a precise and generic approach for disulfide bridge mapping, which can be used to study protein folding, structure, and stability.",

    "abstract": "Western blotting is one of the most commonly used laboratory techniques for identifying proteins and semi-quantifying protein amounts; however, several recent findings suggest that western blots may not be as reliable as previously assumed. This is not surprising since many labs are unaware of the limitations of western blotting. In this manuscript, we review essential strategies for improving confidence in the accuracy of western blots. These strategies include selecting the best normalization standard, proper sample preparation, determining the linear range for antibodies and protein stains relevant to the sample of interest, confirming the quality of the primary antibody, preventing signal saturation and accurately quantifying the signal intensity of the target protein. Although western blotting is a powerful and indispensable scientific technique that can be used to accurately quantify relative protein levels, it is necessary that proper experimental techniques and strategies are employed.",

    "abstract": "We have developed an innovative method to remove albumin from plasma/serum samples for the LC-MS/MS quantitation of therapeutic proteins. Different combinations of organic solvents and acids were screened for their ability to remove albumin from plasma and serum samples. Removal efficiency was monitored by two signature peptides (QTALVELVK and LVNEVTEFAK) from albumin. Isopropanol with 1.0% trichloroacetic acid was found to be the most effective combination to remove albumin while retaining the protein of interest. Our approach was compared with a commercial albumin depletion kit on both efficiency of albumin removal and recovery of target proteins. We have demonstrated that our approach can remove 95% of the total albumin in human plasma samples while retaining close to 100% for two of three therapeutic proteins tested, with the third one at 60-80%. The commercial kit removed 98% of albumin but suffered at least 50% recovery loss for all therapeutic proteins when compared to our approach. Using BMS-C as a probe compound, the incorporation of the albumin removal approach has improved both assay sensitivity and ruggedness, compared to the whole plasma protein digestion approach alone. An LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated based on this new approach for the analysis of BMS-C in monkey serum. This assay was successfully applied to a toxicological study. When the albumin removal method was used in another clinical LC-MS/MS method, the sensitivity improved 10-fold to 50 ng/mL LLOQ comparing to a typical pellet digestion method.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry plays a key role in relative quantitative comparisons of proteins in order to understand their functional role in biological systems upon perturbation. In this review, we review studies that examine different aspects of isobaric labeling-based relative quantification for shotgun proteomic analysis. In particular, we focus on different types of isobaric reagents and their reaction chemistry (e.g., amine-, carbonyl-, and sulfhydryl-reactive). Various factors, such as ratio compression, reporter ion dynamic range, and others, cause an underestimation of changes in relative abundance of proteins across samples, undermining the ability of the isobaric labeling approach to be truly quantitative. These factors that affect quantification and the suggested combinations of experimental design and optimal data acquisition methods to increase the precision and accuracy of the measurements will be discussed. Finally, the extended application of isobaric labeling-based approach in hyperplexing strategy, targeted quantification, and phosphopeptide analysis are also examined.",

Orientations for optional routes are also given according to the objective of the experimental investigations. This covers different approaches to capture proteins of very low abundance. Total protein harvestings to prevent partial losses are also described such as single exhaustive desorption and fractionated elutions for more detailed analyses.

    "abstract": "Advances in phosphopeptide enrichment methods enable the identification of thousands of phosphopeptides from complex samples. Current offline enrichment approaches using TiO(2), Ti, and Fe immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) material in batch or microtip format are widely used, but they suffer from irreproducibility and compromised selectivity. To address these shortcomings, we revisited the merits of performing phosphopeptide enrichment in an HPLC column format. We found that Fe-IMAC columns enabled the selective, comprehensive, and reproducible enrichment of phosphopeptides out of complex lysates. Column enrichment did not suffer from bead-to-sample ratio issues and scaled linearly from 100 μg to 5 mg of digest. Direct measurements on an Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer identified >7500 unique phosphopeptides with 90% selectivity and good quantitative reproducibility (median cv of 15%). The number of unique phosphopeptides could be increased to more than 14,000 when the IMAC eluate was subjected to a subsequent hydrophilic strong anion exchange separation. Fe-IMAC columns outperformed Ti-IMAC and TiO(2) in batch or tip mode in terms of phosphopeptide identification and intensity. Permutation enrichments of flow-throughs showed that all materials largely bound the same phosphopeptide species, independent of physicochemical characteristics. However, binding capacity and elution efficiency did profoundly differ among the enrichment materials and formats. As a result, the often quoted orthogonality of the materials has to be called into question. Our results strongly suggest that insufficient capacity, inefficient elution, and the stochastic nature of data-dependent acquisition in mass spectrometry are the causes of the experimentally observed complementarity. The Fe-IMAC enrichment workflow using an HPLC format developed here enables rapid and comprehensive phosphoproteome analysis that can be applied to a wide range of biological systems.",

In addition, it can also be run on a local computer with computationally intensive tasks launched onto the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service to greatly decrease analysis times. We describe the new Trans-Proteomic Pipeline cloud service components, compare the relative performance and costs of various Elastic Compute Cloud service instance types, and present on-line tutorials that enable users to learn how to deploy cloud computing technology rapidly with the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline.

In the early days of proteomics this interpretation was only based on expert insights, acquired by digesting a large amount of relevant literature. With the growing size and complexity of the experimental datasets, many computational techniques, databases, and tools have claimed a central role in this task. In this review we discuss commonly and less commonly used methods to functionally interpret experimental proteome lists and compare them with available knowledge. We first address several functional analysis and enrichment techniques based on ontologies and literature. Then we outline how various types of network and pathway information can be used. While the problem of functional interpretation of proteome data is to an extent equivalent to the interpretation of transcriptome or other ''omics'' data, this paper addresses some of the specific challenges and solutions of the proteomics field.",

    "abstract": "Cysteine-selective proteomics approaches simplify complex protein mixtures and improve the chance of detecting low abundant proteins. It is possible that cysteinyl-peptide/protein enrichment methods could be coupled to isotopic labeling and isobaric tagging methods for quantitative proteomics analyses in as few as two or up to 10 samples, respectively. Here we present two novel cysteine-selective proteomics approaches: cysteine-selective dimethyl labeling (cysDML) and cysteine-selective combined precursor isotopic labeling and isobaric tagging (cPILOT). CysDML is a duplex precursor quantification technique that couples cysteinyl-peptide enrichment with on-resin stable-isotope dimethyl labeling. Cysteine-selective cPILOT is a novel 12-plex workflow based on cysteinyl-peptide enrichment, on-resin stable-isotope dimethyl labeling, and iodoTMT tagging on cysteine residues. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the approaches, we applied cysDML and cPILOT methods to liver tissues from an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and wild-type (WT) controls. From the cysDML experiments, an average of 850 proteins were identified and 594 were quantified, whereas from the cPILOT experiment, 330 and 151 proteins were identified and quantified, respectively. Overall, 2259 unique total proteins were detected from both cysDML and cPILOT experiments. There is tremendous overlap in the proteins identified and quantified between both experiments, and many proteins have AD/WT fold-change values that are within ~20% error. A total of 65 statistically significant proteins are differentially expressed in the liver proteome of AD mice relative to WT. The performance of cysDML and cPILOT are demonstrated and advantages and limitations of using multiple duplex experiments versus a single 12-plex experiment are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Democratization of genomics technologies has enabled the rapid determination of genotypes. More recently the democratization of comprehensive proteomics technologies is enabling the determination of the cellular phenotype and the molecular events that define its dynamic state. Core proteomic technologies include MS to define protein sequence, protein:protein interactions, and protein PTMs. Key enabling technologies for proteomics are bioinformatic pipelines to identify, quantitate, and summarize these events. The Trans-Proteomics Pipeline (TPP) is a robust open-source standardized data processing pipeline for large-scale reproducible quantitative MS proteomics. It supports all major operating systems and instrument vendors via open data formats. Here, we provide a review of the overall proteomics workflow supported by the TPP, its major tools, and how it can be used in its various modes from desktop to cloud computing. We describe new features for the TPP, including data visualization functionality. We conclude by describing some common perils that affect the analysis of MS/MS datasets, as well as some major upcoming features.",

    "abstract": "Proteins regulate many cellular functions and analyzing the presence and abundance of proteins in biological samples are central focuses in proteomics. The discovery and validation of biomarkers, pathways, and drug targets for various diseases can be accomplished using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. However, with mass-limited samples like tumor biopsies, it can be challenging to obtain sufficient amounts of proteins to generate high-quality mass spectrometric data. Techniques developed for macroscale quantities recover sufficient amounts of protein from milligram quantities of starting material, but sample losses become crippling with these techniques when only microgram amounts of material are available. To combat this challenge, proteomicists have developed micro-scale techniques that are compatible with decreased sample size (100 μg or lower) and still enable excellent proteome coverage. Extraction, contaminant removal, protein quantitation, and sample handling techniques for the microgram protein range are reviewed here, with an emphasis on liquid chromatography and bottom-up mass spectrometry-compatible techniques. Also, a range of biological specimens, including mammalian tissues and model cell culture systems, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Protein chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry enable the analysis of protein-protein interactions and protein topologies; however, complicated cross-linked peptide spectra require specialized algorithms to identify interacting sites. The Kojak cross-linking software application is a new, efficient approach to identify cross-linked peptides, enabling large-scale analysis of protein-protein interactions by chemical cross-linking techniques. The algorithm integrates spectral processing and scoring schemes adopted from traditional database search algorithms and can identify cross-linked peptides using many different chemical cross-linkers with or without heavy isotope labels. Kojak was used to analyze both novel and existing data sets and was compared to existing cross-linking algorithms. The algorithm provided increased cross-link identifications over existing algorithms and, equally importantly, the results in a fraction of computational time. The Kojak algorithm is open-source, cross-platform, and freely available. This software provides both existing and new cross-linking researchers alike an effective way to derive additional cross-link identifications from new or existing data sets. For new users, it provides a simple analytical resource resulting in more cross-link identifications than other methods.",

    "abstract": "Peptide-centered shotgun analysis of proteins has been the core technology in mass spectrometry based proteomics and has enabled numerous biological discoveries, such as the large-scale charting of protein-protein interaction networks, the quantitative analysis of protein post-translational modifications and even the first drafts of the human proteome. The conversion of proteins into peptides in these so-called bottom-up approaches is nearly uniquely done by using trypsin as a proteolytic reagent. Here, we argue that our view of the proteome still remains incomplete and this is partially due to the nearly exclusive use of trypsin. Newly emerging alternative proteases and/or multi-protease protein digestion aim to increase proteome sequence coverage and improve the identification of post-translational modifications, through the analysis of complementary and often longer peptides, introducing an approach termed middle-down proteomics. Of pivotal importance for this purpose is the identification of proteases beneficial for use in proteomics. Here, we describe some of the shortcomings of the nearly exclusive use of trypsin in proteomics and review the properties of other proteomics-appropriate proteases. We describe favorable protease traits with an emphasis on middle-down proteomics and suggest potential sources for the discovery of new proteases. We also highlight a few examples wherein the use of other proteases than trypsin enabled the generation of more comprehensive data sets leading to previously unexplored knowledge of the proteome.",

    "abstract": "The determination of total protein content is one of the most frequent analytical tasks in biochemistry and molecular biology. Here we evaluate measurements of tryptophan fluorescence (WF) for total protein determination in whole tissue lysates and for peptide quantification in protein digests. We demonstrate that the fluorescence spectrometry of tryptophan offers a simple, sensitive, and direct method for protein and peptide assays. The WF assay is fully compatible with SDS and other solutes that are commonly used for lysis of tissue and cells. We found that the content of tryptophan varies only a little between mouse tissues (1.16 ± 0.08% of total amino acids) and is similar in human cells (1.19 ± 0.06%). Therefore, free tryptophan can be used as a universal standard. We show that the assay can be carried out on a standard fluorescence spectrometer with cuvettes as well as in a 96-well format using a plate reader. The method is particularly suitable for determination of peptide content in diluted samples. Notably, the whole sample can be recovered after the measurement.",

    "abstract": "Secreted proteases act on interstitial tissue secretomes released from multiple cell types. Thus, substrate proteins might be part of higher molecular complexes constituted by many proteins with diverse and potentially unknown cellular origin. In cell culture, these may be reconstituted by mixing native secretomes from different cell types prior to incubation with a test protease. Although current degradomics techniques could identify novel substrate proteins in these complexes, all information on the cellular origin is lost. To address this limitation, we combined iTRAQ-based terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (iTRAQ-TAILS) with SILAC to assign proteins to a specific cell type by MS1- and their cleavage by MS2-based quantification in the same experiment. We demonstrate the power of our newly established workflow by monitoring matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 10 dependent cleavages in mixtures from light-labeled keratinocyte and heavy-labeled fibroblast secretomes. This analysis correctly assigned extracellular matrix components, such as laminins and collagens, to their respective cellular origins and revealed their processing in an MMP10-dependent manner. Hence, our newly devised degradomics workflow facilitates deeper insight into protease activity in complex intercellular compartments such as the epidermal-dermal interface by integrating multiple modes of quantification with positional proteomics. All MS data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001643 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD001643).",

    "abstract": "Introduction of antibodies specific for acetylated lysine has significantly improved the detection of endogenous acetylation sites by mass spectrometry. Here, we describe a new, commercially available mixture of anti-lysine acetylation (Kac) antibodies and show its utility for in-depth profiling of the acetylome. Specifically, seven complementary monoclones with high specificity for Kac were combined into a final anti-Kac reagent which results in at least a twofold increase in identification of Kac peptides over a commonly used Kac antibody. We outline optimal antibody usage conditions, effective offline basic reversed phase separation, and use of state-of-the-art LC-MS technology for achieving unprecedented coverage of the acetylome. The methods were applied to quantify acetylation sites in suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid-treated Jurkat cells. Over 10,000 Kac peptides from over 3000 Kac proteins were quantified from a single stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture labeled sample using 7.5 mg of peptide input per state. This constitutes the deepest coverage of acetylation sites in quantitative experiments obtained to-date. The approach was also applied to breast tumor xenograft samples using isobaric mass tag labeling of peptides (iTRAQ4, TMT6 and TMT10-plex reagents) for quantification. Greater than 6700 Kac peptides from over 2300 Kac proteins were quantified using 1 mg of tumor protein per iTRAQ 4-plex channel. The novel reagents and methods we describe here enable quantitative, global acetylome analyses with depth and sensitivity approaching that obtained for other well-studied post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, and should have widespread application in biological and clinical studies employing mass spectrometry-based proteomics.",

    "abstract": "De novo sequencing software has been widely used in proteomics to sequence new peptides from tandem mass spectrometry data. This study presents a new software tool, Novor, to greatly improve both the speed and accuracy of today's peptide de novo sequencing analyses. To improve the accuracy, Novor's scoring functions are based on two large decision trees built from a peptide spectral library with more than 300,000 spectra with machine learning. Important knowledge about peptide fragmentation is extracted automatically from the library and incorporated into the scoring functions. The decision tree model also enables efficient score calculation and contributes to the speed improvement. To further improve the speed, a two-stage algorithmic approach, namely dynamic programming and refinement, is used. The software program was also carefully optimized. On the testing datasets, Novor sequenced 7%-37% more correct residues than the state-of-the-art de novo sequencing tool, PEAKS, while being an order of magnitude faster. Novor can de novo sequence more than 300 MS/MS spectra per second on a laptop computer. The speed surpasses the acquisition speed of today's mass spectrometer and, therefore, opens a new possibility to de novo sequence in real time while the spectrometer is acquiring the spectral data.

    "abstract": "Protein function prediction from sequence using the Gene Ontology (GO) classification is useful in many biological problems. It has recently attracted increasing interest, thanks in part to the Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) challenge. In this paper, we introduce Guilty by Association on STRING (GAS), a tool to predict protein function exploiting protein-protein interaction networks without sequence similarity. The assumption is that whenever a protein interacts with other proteins, it is part of the same biological process and located in the same cellular compartment. GAS retrieves interaction partners of a query protein from the STRING database and measures enrichment of the associated functional annotations to generate a sorted list of putative functions. A performance evaluation based on CAFA metrics and a fair comparison with optimized BLAST similarity searches is provided. The consensus of GAS and BLAST is shown to improve overall performance. The PPI approach is shown to outperform similarity searches for biological process and cellular compartment GO predictions. Moreover, an analysis of the best practices to exploit protein-protein interaction networks is also provided.",

    "abstract": "Colorimetric protein assays, such as the Coomassie blue G-250 dye-binding (Bradford) and bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assays, are commonly used to quantify protein concentration. The accuracy of these assays depends on the amino acid composition. Because of the extensive use of reductive methylation in the study of proteins and the importance of biological methylation, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of lysyl methylation on the Bradford and BCA assays. Unmodified and reductively methylated proteins were analyzed using the absorbance at 280 nm to standardize the concentrations. Using model compounds, we demonstrate that the dimethylation of lysyl ε-amines does not affect the proteins' molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm. For the Bradford assay, the responses (absorbance per unit concentration) of the unmodified and reductively methylated proteins were similar, with a slight decrease in the response upon methylation. For the BCA assay, the responses of the reductively methylated proteins were consistently higher, overestimating the concentrations of the methylated proteins. The enhanced color formation in the BCA assay may be due to the lower acid dissociation constants of the lysyl ε-dimethylamines compared with the unmodified ε-amine, favoring Cu(II) binding in biuret-like complexes. The implications for the analysis of biologically methylated samples are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Most shotgun proteomics data analysis workflows are based on the assumption that each fragment ion spectrum is explained by a single species of peptide ion isolated by the mass spectrometer; however, in reality mass spectrometers often isolate more than one peptide ion within the window of isolation that contribute to additional peptide fragment peaks in many spectra. We present a new tool called reSpect, implemented in the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP), which enables an iterative workflow whereby fragment ion peaks explained by a peptide ion identified in one round of sequence searching or spectral library search are attenuated based on the confidence of the identification, and then the altered spectrum is subjected to further rounds of searching. The reSpect tool is not implemented as a search engine, but rather as a post-search engine processing step where only fragment ion intensities are altered. This enables the application of any search engine combination in the iterations that follow. Thus, reSpect is compatible with all other protein sequence database search engines as well as peptide spectral library search engines that are supported by the TPP. We show that while some datasets are highly amenable to chimeric spectrum identification and lead to additional peptide identification boosts of over 30% with as many as four different peptide ions identified per spectrum, datasets with narrow precursor ion selection only benefit from such processing at the level of a few percent. We demonstrate a technique that facilitates the determination of the degree to which a dataset would benefit from chimeric spectrum analysis. The reSpect tool is free and open source, provided within the TPP and available at the TPP website. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.",

    "abstract": "Post translational modification of proteins is a critical requirement that regulates function. Among the diverse kinds of protein post translational modifications, phosphorylation plays essential roles in protein folding, protein:protein interactions, signal transduction, intracellular localization, transcription regulation, cell cycle progression, survival and apoptosis. Protein phosphorylation is also essential for many intracellular pathogens to establish a productive infection cycle. Preservation of protein phosphorylation moieties in pathogens in a manner that mirrors the host components underscores the co-evolutionary trajectory of pathogens and hosts, and sheds light on how successful pathogens have usurped, either in part or as a whole, the host enzymatic machinery. Phosphorylation of viral proteins for many acute RNA viruses including Flaviviruses and Alphaviruses has been demonstrated to be critical for protein functionality. This review focuses on phosphorylation modifications that have been documented to occur on viral proteins with emphasis on acutely infectious, single stranded RNA viruses. The review additionally explores the possibility of repurposing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved inhibitors as antivirals for the treatment of acute RNA viral infections.",

    "abstract": "Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) has been the method of choice for phosphopeptide enrichment prior to mass spectrometric analysis for many years and it is still used extensively in many laboratories. Using the affinity of negatively charged phosphate groups towards positively charged metal ions such as Fe(3+), Ga(3+), Al(3+), Zr(4+), and Ti(4+) has made it possible to enrich phosphorylated peptides from peptide samples. However, the selectivity of most of the metal ions is limited, when working with highly complex samples, e.g., whole-cell extracts, resulting in contamination from nonspecific binding of non-phosphorylated peptides. This problem is mainly caused by highly acidic peptides that also share high binding affinity towards these metal ions. By lowering the pH of the loading buffer nonspecific binding can be reduced significantly, however with the risk of reducing specific binding capacity. After binding, the enriched phosphopeptides are released from the metal ions using alkaline buffers of pH 10-11, EDTA, or phosphate-containing buffers. Here we describe a protocol for IMAC using Fe(3+) for phosphopeptide enrichment. The principles are illustrated on a semi-complex peptide mixture.",

Many important cell cycle regulators, including many oncogenes and tumor suppressors, are functionally regulated via SUMOylation. The dynamic SUMOylation pattern observed throughout the cell cycle is ensured via distinct spatial and temporal regulation of the SUMO machinery. Additionally, SUMOylation cooperates with other post-translational modifications to mediate cell cycle progression. Deregulation of these SUMOylation and deSUMOylation enzymes causes severe defects in cell proliferation and genome stability. Different types of cancer were recently shown to be dependent on a functioning SUMOylation system, a finding that could be exploited in anticancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "Endoproteinase Asp-N, a metalloprotease from a mutant strain of Pseudomonas fragi, has been reported to specifically cleave on the N-terminal side of aspartyl and cysteic acid residues. We utilized this enzyme to generate fragments for determining the amino acid sequence of the D-aspartyl/L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase isozyme I from human erythrocytes. Surprisingly, we identified cleavage sites for this enzyme at the N-terminal side of several glutamyl residues in addition to the expected cleavage sites at aspartyl residues. The ability of this enzyme to cleave polypeptides at both glutamyl and aspartyl residues was confirmed by mapping additional sites on erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase I. These results indicate that a more appropriate name for this enzyme may be Endoproteinase Asp/Glu-N.",

    "abstract": "Common yet often overlooked, deamidation of peptidyl asparagine (Asn or N) generates aspartic acid (Asp or D) or isoaspartic acid (isoAsp or isoD). Being a spontaneous, non-enzymatic protein post-translational modification, deamidation artifact can be easily introduced during sample preparation, especially proteolysis where higher-order structures are removed. This artifact not only complicates the analysis of bona fide deamidation but also affects a wide range of chemical and enzymatic processes; for instance, the newly generated Asp and isoAsp residues may block or introduce new proteolytic sites, and also convert one Asn peptide into multiple species that affect quantification. While the neutral to mildly basic conditions for common proteolysis favor deamidation, mildly acidic conditions markedly slow down the process. Unlike other commonly used endoproteases, Glu-C remains active under mildly acid conditions. As such, as demonstrated herein, deamidation artifact during proteolysis was effectively eliminated by simply performing Glu-C digestion at pH 4.5 in ammonium acetate, a volatile buffer that is compatible with mass spectrometry. Moreover, nearly identical sequence specificity was observed at both pH's (8.0 for ammonium bicarbonate), rendering Glu-C as effective at pH 4.5. In summary, this method is generally applicable for protein analysis as it requires minimal sample preparation and uses the readily available Glu-C protease.",

    "abstract": "Protein digestion using a dedicated protease represents a key element in a typical mass spectrometry (MS)-based shotgun proteomics experiment. Up to now, digestion has been predominantly performed with trypsin, mainly because of its high specificity, widespread availability and ease of use. Lately, it has become apparent that the sole use of trypsin in bottom-up proteomics may impose certain limits in our ability to grasp the full proteome, missing out particular sites of post-translational modifications, protein segments or even subsets of proteins. To overcome this problem, the proteomics community has begun to explore alternative proteases to complement trypsin. However, protocols, as well as expected results generated from these alternative proteases, have not been systematically documented. Therefore, here we provide an optimized protocol for six alternative proteases that have already shown promise in their applicability in proteomics, namely chymotrypsin, LysC, LysN, AspN, GluC and ArgC. This protocol is formulated to promote ease of use and robustness, which enable parallel digestion with each of the six tested proteases. We present data on protease availability and usage including recommendations for reagent preparation. We additionally describe the appropriate MS data analysis methods and the anticipated results in the case of the analysis of a single protein (BSA) and a more complex cellular lysate (Escherichia coli). The digestion protocol presented here is convenient and robust and can be completed in ∼2 d.",

    "abstract": "Reversible cysteine modifications play important physiological roles such as modulating enzymatic catalysis, maintaining redox homeostasis and conducting cellular signaling. These roles can be critical in the context of disease. Oxidative modifications such as S-nitrosylation (SNO) are signatures of neurodestruction in conditions of oxidative stress however are also indicators of neuroprotection and normal signaling in cellular environments with low concentrations of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. SNO is a dynamic and low abundance modification and requires sensitive and selective analytical methods for its detection in biological tissues. Here we present an enhanced multiplexing strategy to study SNO in complex mixtures arising from tissues. This method, termed oxidized cysteine-selective cPILOT (OxcyscPILOT), allows simultaneous analysis of SNO-modified peptides in 12 samples. OxcyscPILOT has three primary steps: (1) blocking of free thiols by a cysteine-reactive reagent, (2) enrichment of peptides containing SNO on a solid phase resin, and (3) isotopic labeling and isobaric tagging of enriched peptides on the solid phase resin. This approach offers the advantage of allowing total protein abundance levels to be measured simultaneously with endogenous SNO levels and measurement of SNO levels across four biological replicates in a single analysis. Furthermore, the relative amount of SNO on a specific cysteine site can also be determined. A well-known model of Alzheimer's disease, the APP/PS-1 transgenic mouse model, was selected for demonstration of the method as several SNO-modified proteins have previously been reported in brain and synaptosomes from AD subjects. OxcyscPILOT analysis resulted in identification of 138 SNO-modified cysteines in brain homogenates that correspond to 135 proteins. Many of these SNO-modified proteins were only present in wild-type or AD mice, whereas 93 proteins had SNO signals in both WT and AD. Pathway analysis links SNO-modified proteins to various biological pathways especially metabolism and signal transduction, consistent with previous reports in the literature. The OxcyscPILOT strategy provides enhanced multiplexing capability to current redox proteomics methods to study oxidative modifications of cysteine.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative mass spectrometry data necessitates an analytical pipeline that captures the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the experiments. Currently, data analysis is often coupled to specific software packages, which restricts the analysis to a given workflow and precludes a more thorough characterization of the data by other complementary tools. To address this, we have developed PyQuant, a cross-platform mass spectrometry data quantification application that is compatible with existing frameworks and can be used as a stand-alone quantification tool. PyQuant supports most types of quantitative mass spectrometry data including SILAC, NeuCode, (15)N, (13)C, or (18)O and chemical methods such as iTRAQ or TMT and provides the option of adding custom labeling strategies. In addition, PyQuant can perform specialized analyses such as quantifying isotopically labeled samples where the label has been metabolized into other amino acids and targeted quantification of selected ions independent of spectral assignment. PyQuant is capable of quantifying search results from popular proteomic frameworks such as MaxQuant, Proteome Discoverer, and the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline in addition to several standalone search engines. We have found that PyQuant routinely quantifies a greater proportion of spectral assignments, with increases ranging from 25-45% in this study. Finally, PyQuant is capable of complementing spectral assignments between replicates to quantify ions missed because of lack of MS/MS fragmentation or that were omitted because of issues such as spectra quality or false discovery rates. This results in an increase of biologically useful data available for interpretation. In summary, PyQuant is a flexible mass spectrometry data quantification platform that is capable of interfacing with a variety of existing formats and is highly customizable, which permits easy configuration for custom analysis.",

    "abstract": "Here we provide data for SILAC and iTRAQ based hyperplexing combined with BONCAT based click chemistry for selective enrichment of newly synthesized proteins secreted by THP1 macrophages at various time points after infection with four different strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The macrophages were infected with H37Ra, H37Rv, BND433 and JAL2287 strains of M. tuberculosis. Newly-synthesized secreted host proteins were observed, starting from six hours post-infection till 26 h, at 4 h intervals. We have combined BONCAT with hyperplexing (18-plex), which blends SILAC and iTRAQ, for the first time. Two sets of triplex SILAC were used to encode the strains of M. tuberculosis - H37Ra & H37Rv in one and BND433 & JAL2287 in another with a control in each. BONCAT was used to enrich the secretome for newly synthesized proteins while 6-plex iTRAQ labeling was employed to quantify the temporal changes in the captured proteome. Each set of 18-plex was run in 4 MS replicates with two linear and two non-linear separation modes. This new variant of hyperplexing method, combining triplex SILAC with 6-plex iTRAQ, achieves 18-plex quantitation in a single MS run. Hyperplexing enables large scale spatio-temporal systems biology studies where large number of samples can be processed simultaneously and in quantitative manner.

By globally quantifying the kinetics of protein clearance and synthesis, these methodologies can provide important insights into the regulation of the proteome under varying cellular and environmental conditions. To facilitate such analyses, we have employed a methodology that combines metabolic isotopic labeling (Stable Isotope Labeling in Cell Culture - SILAC) with isobaric tagging (Tandem Mass Tags - TMT) for analysis of multiplexed samples. The fractional labeling of multiple time-points can be measured in a single mass spectrometry run, providing temporally resolved measurements of protein turnover kinetics. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we simultaneously measured the kinetics of protein clearance and accumulation for more than 3000 proteins in dividing and quiescent human fibroblasts and verified the accuracy of the measurements by comparison to established non-multiplexed approaches. The results indicate that upon reaching quiescence, fibroblasts compensate for lack of cellular growth by globally downregulating protein synthesis and upregulating protein degradation. The described methodology significantly reduces the cost and complexity of temporally-resolved dynamic proteomic experiments and improves the precision of proteome-wide turnover data.",

    "abstract": "The enormous depth complexity of the human plasma proteome poses a significant challenge for current mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies in terms of detecting low-level proteins in plasma, which is essential for successful biomarker discovery efforts. Typically, a single-step analytical approach cannot reduce this intrinsic complexity. Current simplex immunodepletion techniques offer limited capacity for detecting low-abundance proteins, and integrated strategies are thus desirable. In this respect, we developed an improved strategy for analyzing the human plasma proteome by integrating polyethylene glycol (PEG) fractionation with immunoaffinity depletion. PEG fractionation of plasma proteins is simple, rapid, efficient, and compatible with a downstream immunodepletion step. Compared with immunodepletion alone, our integrated strategy substantially improved the proteome coverage afforded by PEG fractionation. Coupling this new protocol with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, 135 proteins with reported normal concentrations below 100 ng/mL were confidently identified as common low-abundance proteins. A side-by-side comparison indicated that our integrated strategy was increased by average 43.0% in the identification rate of low-abundance proteins, relying on an average 65.8% increase of the corresponding unique peptides. Further investigation demonstrated that this combined strategy could effectively alleviate the signal-suppressive effects of the major high-abundance proteins by affinity depletion, especially with moderate-abundance proteins after incorporating PEG fractionation, thereby greatly enhancing the detection of low-abundance proteins. In sum, the newly developed strategy of incorporating PEG fractionation to immunodepletion methods can potentially aid in the discovery of plasma biomarkers of therapeutic and clinical interest.",

The search database is one of the major influencing factors in discovering proteins present in the sample and thus in deriving biological conclusions. In most cases the choice of search database is arbitrary. Here we describe common search databases used in proteomic studies and their impact on final list of identified proteins. We also elaborate upon factors like composition and size of the search database that can influence the protein identification process. In conclusion, we suggest that choice of the database depends on the type of inferences to be derived from proteomics data.

Analyses of protein phosphorylation, particularly large scale phosphoproteomic experiments, have recently been enhanced by efficient enrichment, fast and accurate instrumentation, and better software, but challenges remain because of the low stoichiometry of phosphorylation and poor phosphopeptide ionization efficiency and fragmentation due to neutral loss. Phosphoproteomics has become an important dimension in systems biology studies, and it is essential to have efficient analytical tools to cover a broad range of signaling events. To evaluate current mass spectrometric performance, we present here a novel method to estimate the efficiency of phosphopeptide identification by tandem mass spectrometry.

    "abstract": "Structural information regarding metallothioneins (MTs) has been hard to come by due to its highly dynamic nature in the absence of metal-thiolate cluster formation and crystallization difficulties. Thus, typical spectroscopic methods for structural determination are limited in their usefulness when applied to MTs. Mass spectrometric methods have revolutionized our understanding of protein dynamics, structure, and folding. Recently, advances have been made in residue modification mass spectrometry in order to probe the hard-to-characterize structure of apo- and partially metalated MTs. By using different cysteine specific alkylation reagents, time dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and step-wise \"snapshot\" ESI-MS, we are beginning to understand the dynamics of the conformers of apo-MT and related species. In this review we highlight recent papers that use these and similar techniques for structure elucidation and attempt to explain in a concise manner the data interpretations of these complex methods. We expect increasing resolution in our picture of the structural conformations of metal-free MTs as these techniques are more widely adopted and combined with other promising tools for structural elucidation.",

    "abstract": "Reduction and alkylation of cysteine residues is part of virtually any proteomics workflow. Despite its frequent use, up to date no systematic investigation of the impact of different conditions on the outcome of proteomics studies has been performed. In this study, we compared common reduction reagents (dithiothreitol, tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine, and β-mercaptoethanol) and alkylation reagents (iodoacetamide, iodoacetic acid, acrylamide, and chloroacetamide). Using in-gel digests as well as SAX fractionated in-solution digests of cytosolic fractions of HeLa cells, we evaluated 13 different reduction and alkylation conditions resulting in considerably varying identification rates. We observed strong differences in offsite alkylation reactions at 7 amino acids as well as at the peptide N terminus, identifying single and double adducts of all reagents. Using dimethyl labeling, mass tolerant searches, and synthetic peptide experiments, we identified alkylation of methionine residues by iodine-containing alkylation reagents as one of the major factors for the differences. We observed differences of more than 9-fold in numbers of identified methionine-containing peptide spectral matches for in-gel digested samples between iodine- and noniodine-containing alkylation reagents. This was because of formation of carbamidomethylated and carboxymethylated methionine side chains and a resulting prominent neutral loss during ESI ionization or in MS/MS fragmentation, strongly decreasing identification rates of methionine-containing peptides. We achieved best results with acrylamide as alkylation reagent, whereas the highest numbers of peptide spectral matches were obtained when reducing with dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol for the in-solution and the in-gel digested samples, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine nitration by oxidative and nitrate stress is important in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory or aging-related diseases. Mass spectrometry analysis of protein nitrotyrosine is very challenging because the non-nitrated peptides suppress the signals of the low-abundance nitrotyrosine (NT) peptides. No validated methods for enrichment of NT-peptides are currently available. Here we report an immunoaffinity enrichment of NT-peptides for proteomics analysis. The effectiveness of this approach was evaluated using nitrated protein standards and whole-cell lysates in vitro. A total of 1881 NT sites were identified from a nitrated whole-cell extract, indicating that this immunoaffinity-MS method is a valid approach for the enrichment of NT-peptides, and provides a significant advance for characterizing the nitrotyrosine proteome. We noted that this method had higher affinity to peptides with N-terminal nitrotyrosine relative to peptides with other nitrotyrosine locations, which raises the need for future study to develop a pan-specific nitrotyrosine antibody for unbiased, proteome-wide analysis of tyrosine nitration. We applied this method to quantify the changes in protein tyrosine nitration in mouse lungs after intranasal poly(I:C) treatment and quantified 237 NT sites. This result indicates that the immunoaffinity-MS method can be used for quantitative analysis of protein nitrotyrosines in complex samples.",

    "abstract": "Efficient and reproducible sample preparation is a prerequisite for any robust and sensitive quantitative bottom-up proteomics workflow. Here, we performed an independent comparison between single-pot solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3), filter-aided sample preparation (FASP), and a commercial kit based on the in-StageTip (iST) method. We assessed their performance for the processing of proteomic samples in the low μg range using varying amounts of HeLa cell lysate (1-20 μg of total protein). All three workflows showed similar performances for 20 μg of starting material. When handling sample sizes below 10 μg, the number of identified proteins and peptides as well as the quantitative reproducibility and precision drastically dropped in case of FASP. In contrast, SP3 and iST provided high proteome coverage even in the low μg range. Even when digesting 1 μg of starting material, both methods still enabled the identification of over 3000 proteins and between 25 000 and 30 000 peptides. On average, the quantitative reproducibility between experimental replicates was slightly higher in case of SP3 (R",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS) has become an increasingly important technique to analyze proteins. In popular bottom-up MS-based proteomics, reduction and alkylation are routine steps to facilitate peptide identification. However, incomplete reactions and side reactions may occur, which compromise the experimental results. In this work, we systematically evaluated the reduction step with commonly used reagents, i.e., dithiothreitol, 2-mercaptoethanol, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, or tris(3-hydroxypropyl)phosphine, and alkylation with iodoacetamide, acrylamide, N-ethylmaleimide, or 4-vinylpyridine. By using digested peptides from a yeast whole-cell lysate, the number of proteins and peptides identified were very similar using four different reducing reagents. The results from four alkylating reagents, however, were dramatically different with iodoacetamide giving the highest number of peptides with alkylated cysteine and the lowest number of peptides with incomplete cysteine alkylation and side reactions. Alkylation conditions with iodoacetamide were further optimized. To identify more peptides with cysteine, thiopropyl-sepharose 6B resins were used to enrich them, and the optimal conditions were employed for the reduction and alkylation. The enrichment resulted in over three times more cysteine-containing peptides than without enrichment. Systematic evaluation of the reduction and alkylation with different reagents can aid in a better design of bottom-up proteomic experiments.",

    "abstract": "Protein structural changes induced by external perturbations or internal cues can profoundly influence protein activity and thus modulate cellular physiology. A number of biophysical approaches are available to probe protein structural changes, but these are not applicable to a whole proteome in a biological extract. Limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) is a recently developed proteomics approach that enables the identification of protein structural changes directly in their complex biological context on a proteome-wide scale. After perturbations of interest, proteome extracts are subjected to a double-protease digestion step with a nonspecific protease applied under native conditions, followed by complete digestion with the sequence-specific protease trypsin under denaturing conditions. This sequential treatment generates structure-specific peptides amenable to bottom-up MS analysis. Next, a proteomics workflow involving shotgun or targeted MS and label-free quantification is applied to measure structure-dependent proteolytic patterns directly in the proteome extract. Possible applications of LiP-MS include discovery of perturbation-induced protein structural alterations, identification of drug targets, detection of disease-associated protein structural states, and analysis of protein aggregates directly in biological samples. The approach also enables identification of the specific protein regions involved in the structural transition or affected by the binding event. Sample preparation takes approximately 2 d, followed by one to several days of MS and data analysis time, depending on the number of samples analyzed. Scientists with basic biochemistry training can implement the sample preparation steps. MS measurement and data analysis require a background in proteomics.",

    "abstract": "Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification regulates numerous cellular processes. Unlike ubiquitin, detection of endogenous SUMOylated proteins is limited by the lack of naturally occurring protease sites in the C-terminal tail of SUMO proteins. Proteome-wide detection of SUMOylation sites on target proteins typically requires ectopic expression of mutant SUMOs with introduced tryptic sites. Here, we report a method for proteome-wide, site-level detection of endogenous SUMOylation that uses α-lytic protease, WaLP. WaLP digestion of SUMOylated proteins generates peptides containing SUMO-remnant diglycyl-lysine (KGG) at the site of SUMO modification. Using previously developed immuno-affinity isolation of KGG-containing peptides followed by mass spectrometry, we identified 1209 unique endogenous SUMO modification sites. We also demonstrate the impact of proteasome inhibition on ubiquitin and SUMO-modified proteomes using parallel quantitation of ubiquitylated and SUMOylated peptides. This methodological advancement enables determination of endogenous SUMOylated proteins under completely native conditions.",

    "abstract": "A genetic approach is described to clarify the IgG-binding properties of the N-terminal portion of staphylococcal protein A (region E). Several gene fragments, encoding region E or B or protein A, have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene products were purified by IgG-affinity chromatography and subjected to structural and functional analyses. Both fragments can be efficiently purified using this method, suggesting that region B as well as region E has Fc-binding activity. In addition, gene fusions were assembled giving fragments EB and EE, which both showed a divalent Fc-binding. These results demonstrate that protein A consists of five IgG-binding domains. The implications of these findings for the structure of protein-A--immunoglobulin-G complexes are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is one of the most common polymer contaminations in mass spectrometry (MS) samples. At present, the detection of PEG and other polymers relies largely on manual inspection of raw data, which is laborious and frequently difficult due to sample complexity and retention characteristics of polymer species in reversed-phase chromatography. We developed a new strategy for the automated identification of PEG molecules from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data using protein identification algorithms in combination with a database containing \"PEG-proteins\". Through definition of variable modifications, we extend the approach for the identification of commonly used PEG-based detergents. We exemplify the identification of different types of polymers by static nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (nanoESI-MS/MS) analysis of pure detergent solutions and data analysis using Mascot. Analysis of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) runs of a PEG-contaminated sample by Mascot identified 806 PEG spectra originating from four PEG species using a defined set of modifications covering PEG and common PEG-based detergents. Further characterization of the sample for unidentified PEG species using error-tolerant and mass-tolerant searches resulted in identification of 3409 and 3187 PEG-related MS/MS spectra, respectively. We further demonstrate the applicability of the strategy for Protein Pilot and MaxQuant.",

    "abstract": "Bottom-up proteomic strategies rely on efficient digestion of proteins into peptides for mass spectrometry analysis. In-solution and filter-based strategies are commonly used for proteomic analysis. In recent years, filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) has become the dominant filter-based method due to its ability to remove SDS prior to mass spectrometry analysis. However, the time-consuming nature of FASP protocols have led to the development of new filter-based strategies. Suspension traps (S-Traps) were recently reported as an alternative to FASP and in-solution strategies as they allow for high concentrations of SDS in a fraction of the time of a typical FASP protocol. In this study, we compare the yields from in-solution, FASP, and S-Trap based digestions of proteins extracted in SDS and urea-based lysis buffers. We performed label-free quantification to analyze the differences in the portions of the proteome identified using each method. Overall, our results show that each digestion method had a high degree of reproducibility within the method type. However, S-Traps outperformed FASP and in-solution digestions by providing the most efficient digestion with the greatest number of unique protein identifications. This is the first work to provide a direct quantitative comparison of two filter-based digestion methods and a traditional in-solution approach to provide information regarding the most efficient proteomic preparation.",

    "abstract": "Numerous centrality measures have been introduced to identify \"central\" nodes in large networks. The availability of a wide range of measures for ranking influential nodes leaves the user to decide which measure may best suit the analysis of a given network. The choice of a suitable measure is furthermore complicated by the impact of the network topology on ranking influential nodes by centrality measures. To approach this problem systematically, we examined the centrality profile of nodes of yeast protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) in order to detect which centrality measure is succeeding in predicting influential proteins. We studied how different topological network features are reflected in a large set of commonly used centrality measures.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we have reported a novel fabrication technique for human serum albumin (HSA) imprinted composite bacterial cellulose nanofibers (MIP-cBCNFs) used for the depletion of HSA selectively from artificial blood plasma for proteomic applications. Molecular imprinting was achieved by using metal ion coordination interactions of N‑methacryloyl‑(l)‑histidinemethylester (MAH) monomer and Cu(II) ions. MAH-Cu(II)-HSA complex was polymerized with bacterial cellulose nanofibers (BCNFs) under constant stirring at room temperature. The characterization of the MIP-cBCNFs was carried out by FTIR-ATR, SEM, contact angle measurements and surface area measurements. The adsorption experiments of HSA onto the MIP-BCNFs and NIP-BCNFs from aqueous HSA solutions were investigated in a batch system. The selectivity of the MIP-cBCNFs was investigated by using non-template human transferrin (HTR), and myoglobin (Myo). The relative selectivity coefficients of the MIP-cBCNFs were calculated as 4.73 and 3.02 for HSA/HTR and HSA/Myo molecules, respectively. In addition, the depletion of HSA from artificial human plasma was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and 2-D gel electrophoresis. As a result, it has been shown that metal ion coordination interactions contribute to specific binding of template when preparing MIP-cBCNFs for the depletion of HSA with a high adsorption capacity, significant selectivity and reusability.",

    "abstract": "Quantification of individual proteins is an essential task in understanding biological processes. For example, determination of concentrations of proteins transporting and metabolizing xenobiotics is a prerequisite for drug disposition predictions in humans based on in vitro data. So far, this task has frequently been accomplished by targeted proteomics. This type of analyses requires preparation of stable isotope labeled standards for each protein of interest. The selection of appropriate standard peptides is usually tedious and the number of proteins that can be studied in a single experiment by these approaches is limited. In addition, incomplete digestion of proteins often affects the accuracy of the quantification. To circumvent these constrains in proteomic protein quantification, label- and standard-free approaches, such as \"total protein approach\" (TPA) have been proposed. Here we directly compare an approach using stable isotope labeled (SIL) standards and TPA for quantification of transporters and enzymes in human liver samples within the same LC-MS/MS runs. We show that TPA is a convenient alternative to SIL-based methods. Optimization of the sample preparation beyond commonly used single tryptic digestion, by adding consecutive cleavage steps, improves accuracy and reproducibility of the TPA method to a level, which is achievable by analysis using stable isotope-labeled standard spiking.",

    "abstract": "For 15 years the mission of PhosphoSitePlus® (PSP, https://www.phosphosite.org) has been to provide comprehensive information and tools for the study of mammalian post-translational modifications (PTMs). The number of unique PTMs in PSP is now more than 450 000 from over 22 000 articles and thousands of MS datasets. The most important areas of growth in PSP are in disease and isoform informatics. Germline mutations associated with inherited diseases and somatic cancer mutations have been added to the database and can now be viewed along with PTMs and associated quantitative information on novel 'lollipop' plots. These plots enable researchers to interactively visualize the overlap between disease variants and PTMs, and to identify mutations that may alter phenotypes by rewiring signaling networks. We are expanding the sequence space to include over 30 000 human and mouse isoforms to enable researchers to explore the important but understudied biology of isoforms. This represents a necessary expansion of sequence space to accommodate the growing precision and depth of coverage enabled by ongoing advances in mass spectrometry. Isoforms are aligned using a new algorithm. Exploring the worlds of PTMs and disease mutations in the entire isoform space will hopefully lead to new biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and insights into isoform biology.",

    "abstract": "To quantify dynamic protein synthesis rates, we developed MITNCAT, a method combining multiplexed isobaric mass tagging with pulsed SILAC (pSILAC) and bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to label newly synthesized proteins with azidohomoalanine (Aha), thus enabling high temporal resolution across multiple conditions in a single analysis. MITNCAT quantification of protein synthesis rates following induction of the unfolded protein response revealed global down-regulation of protein synthesis, with stronger down-regulation of glycolytic and protein synthesis machinery proteins, but up-regulation of several key chaperones. Waves of temporally distinct protein synthesis were observed in response to epidermal growth factor, with altered synthesis detectable in the first 15 min. Comparison of protein synthesis with mRNA sequencing and ribosome footprinting distinguished protein synthesis driven by increased transcription versus increased translational efficiency. Temporal delays between ribosome occupancy and protein synthesis were observed and found to correlate with altered codon usage in significantly delayed proteins.",

The nucleotide sequence contains an open reading frame which codes for the 198-residue mature enzyme and a potential prepro-peptide, also of 198 residues. The COOH-terminal 49 residues of the pro-peptide are significantly homologous to the propeptides of Streptomyces griseus proteases A and B. We suggest that this pro-peptide region facilitates formation of the active enzyme. A region bridging the NH2-terminal pre- and pro-peptides is homologous to a maize inhibitor of serine proteases. We speculate that this region inhibits enzymatic activity of the prepro-enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Decoy database search with target-decoy competition (TDC) provides an intuitive, easy-to-implement method for estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) associated with spectrum identifications from shotgun proteomics data. However, the procedure can yield different results for a fixed data set analyzed with different decoy databases, and this decoy-induced variability is particularly problematic for smaller FDR thresholds, data sets, or databases. The average TDC (aTDC) protocol combats this problem by exploiting multiple independently shuffled decoy databases to provide an FDR estimate with reduced variability. We provide a tutorial introduction to aTDC, describe an improved variant of the protocol that offers increased statistical power, and discuss how to deploy aTDC in practice using the Crux software toolkit.",

    "abstract": "In the postgenome era, biologists have sought to measure the complete complement of proteins, termed proteomics. Currently, the most effective method to measure the proteome is with shotgun, or bottom-up, proteomics, in which the proteome is digested into peptides that are identified followed by protein inference. Despite continuous improvements to all steps of the shotgun proteomics workflow, observed proteome coverage is often low; some proteins are identified by a single peptide sequence. Complete proteome sequence coverage would allow comprehensive characterization of RNA splicing variants and all posttranslational modifications, which would drastically improve the accuracy of biological models. There are many reasons for the sequence coverage deficit, but ultimately peptide length determines sequence observability. Peptides that are too short are lost because they match many protein sequences and their true origin is ambiguous. The maximum observable peptide length is determined by several analytical challenges. This paper explores computationally how peptide lengths produced from several common proteome digestion methods limit observable proteome coverage. Iterative proteome cleavage strategies are also explored. These simulations reveal that maximized proteome coverage can be achieved by use of an iterative digestion protocol involving multiple proteases and chemical cleavages that theoretically allow 92.9% proteome coverage.",

    "abstract": "Isobaric stable isotope labeling using, for example, tandem mass tags (TMTs) is increasingly being applied for large-scale proteomic studies. Experiments focusing on proteoform analysis in drug time course or perturbation studies or in large patient cohorts greatly benefit from the reproducible quantification of single peptides across samples. However, such studies often require labeling of hundreds of micrograms of peptides such that the cost for labeling reagents represents a major contribution to the overall cost of an experiment. Here, we describe and evaluate a robust and cost-effective protocol for TMT labeling that reduces the quantity of required labeling reagent by a factor of eight and achieves complete labeling. Under- and overlabeling of peptides derived from complex digests of tissues and cell lines were systematically evaluated using peptide quantities of between 12.5 and 800 μg and TMT-to-peptide ratios (wt/wt) ranging from 8:1 to 1:2 at different TMT and peptide concentrations. When reaction volumes were reduced to maintain TMT and peptide concentrations of at least 10 mm and 2 g/l, respectively, TMT-to-peptide ratios as low as 1:1 (wt/wt) resulted in labeling efficiencies of > 99% and excellent intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility. The utility of the optimized protocol was further demonstrated in a deep-scale proteome and phosphoproteome analysis of patient-derived xenograft tumor tissue benchmarked against the labeling procedure recommended by the TMT vendor. Finally, we discuss the impact of labeling reaction parameters for N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-based chemistry and provide guidance on adopting efficient labeling protocols for different peptide quantities.",

    "abstract": "Proteomics by mass spectrometry (MS) allows the large-scale identification and quantitation of the cellular proteins in a given biological context. Systems biology studies from proteomics data are largely limited by the accuracy and coverage of quantitative proteomics along with missing values. Toward this end, statistically robust biological observations are required, comprising multiple replicates, preferably with little technical variations. Multiplexed labeling techniques in proteomics allow quantitative comparisons of several biological samples or conditions. In this focused Review, we discuss an emerging technique called higher order multiplexing or enhanced multiplexing, a unique combination of traditional MS",

    "abstract": "The dynamic nature of protein posttranslational modification (PTM) allows cells to rapidly respond to changes in their environment, such as nutrition, stress, or signaling. Lysine residues are targets for several types of modifications, including methylation, ubiquitination, and various acylation groups, especially acetylation. Currently, one of the best methods for identification and quantification of protein acetylation is immunoaffinity enrichment in combination with high-resolution mass spectrometry. As we are using a relatively novel and comprehensive mass spectrometric approach, data-independent acquisition (DIA), this protocol provides high-throughput, accurate, and reproducible label-free PTM quantification. Here we describe detailed protocols to process relatively small amounts of mouse liver tissue that integrate isolation of proteins, proteolytic digestion into peptides, immunoaffinity enrichment of acetylated peptides, identification of acetylation sites, and comprehensive quantification of relative abundance changes for thousands of identified lysine acetylation sites.",

    "abstract": "Spectral matching sequence database search engines commonly used on mass spectrometry-based proteomics experiments excel at identifying peptide sequence ions, and in addition, possible sequence ions carrying post-translational modifications (PTMs), but most do not provide confidence metrics for the exact localization of those PTMs when several possible sites are available. Localization is absolutely required for downstream molecular cell biology analysis of PTM function in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we developed PTMProphet, a free and open-source software tool integrated into the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline, which reanalyzes identified spectra from any search engine for which pepXML output is available to provide localization confidence to enable appropriate further characterization of biologic events. Localization of any type of mass modification (e.g., phosphorylation) is supported. PTMProphet applies Bayesian mixture models to compute probabilities for each site/peptide spectrum match where a PTM has been identified. These probabilities can be combined to compute a global false localization rate at any threshold to guide downstream analysis. We describe the PTMProphet tool, its underlying algorithms, and demonstrate its performance on ground-truth synthetic peptide reference data sets, one previously published small data set, one new larger data set, and also on a previously published phosphoenriched data set where the correct sites of modification are unknown.

Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) provides a wide range of useful tools through its web interfaces for analyses such as sequence database search, statistical validation, and quantitation. To utilize the powerful functionality of TPP without the need for manual intervention to launch each step, we developed a software tool, called WinProphet, to create and automatically execute a pipeline for proteomic analyses. It seamlessly integrates with TPP and other external command-line programs, supporting various functionalities, including database search for protein and peptide identification, spectral library construction and search, data-independent acquisition (DIA) data analysis, and isobaric labeling and label-free quantitation. WinProphet is a standalone, installation-free tool with graphical interfaces for users to configure, manage, and automatically execute pipelines. The constructed pipelines can be exported as XML files with all of the parameter settings for reusability and portability. The executable files, user manual, and sample data sets of WinProphet are freely available at  http://ms.iis.sinica.edu.tw/COmics/Software_WinProphet.html .",

    "abstract": "We propose to use cRFP (common Repository of FBS Proteins) in the MS (mass spectrometry) raw data search of cell secretomes. cRFP is a small supplementary sequence list of highly abundant fetal bovine serum proteins added to the reference database in use. The aim behind using cRFP is to prevent the contaminant FBS proteins from being misidentified as other proteins in the reference database, just as we would use cRAP (common Repository of Adventitious Proteins) to prevent contaminant proteins present either by accident or through unavoidable contacts from being misidentified as other proteins. We expect it to be widely used in experiments where the proteins are obtained from serum-free media after thorough washing of the cells, or from a complex media such as SILAC, or from extracellular vesicles directly.",

    "abstract": "Plasma and serum are widely used for proteomics-based biomarker discovery. However, analysis of these biofluids is highly challenging due to the complexity and wide dynamic range of their proteomes. Notably, highly abundant proteins tend to obscure the detection of potential biomarkers that are usually of lower concentrations. Among the strategies to resolve this problem are: depletion of high-abundance proteins, enrichment of low abundant proteins of interest and prefractionation. In this review, we focus on current and emerging depletion techniques used to enhance the detection and identification of the less abundant proteins in plasma and serum. We discuss the applications and contributions of these methods to proteomics analysis of plasma and serum alongside their limitations and future perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification regulating protein function in almost all cellular processes. Although tens of thousands of phosphorylation sites have been identified in human cells, approaches to determine the functional importance of each phosphosite are lacking. Here, we manually curated 112 datasets of phospho-enriched proteins, generated from 104 different human cell types or tissues. We re-analyzed the 6,801 proteomics experiments that passed our quality control criteria, creating a reference phosphoproteome containing 119,809 human phosphosites. To prioritize functional sites, we used machine learning to identify 59 features indicative of proteomic, structural, regulatory or evolutionary relevance and integrate them into a single functional score. Our approach identifies regulatory phosphosites across different molecular mechanisms, processes and diseases, and reveals genetic susceptibilities at a genomic scale. Several regulatory phosphosites were experimentally validated, including identifying a role in neuronal differentiation for phosphosites in SMARCC2, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput and streamlined workflows are essential in clinical proteomics for standardized processing of samples from a variety of sources, including fresh-frozen tissue, FFPE tissue, or blood. To reach this goal, we have implemented single-pot solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) on a liquid handling robot for automated processing (autoSP3) of tissue lysates in a 96-well format. AutoSP3 performs unbiased protein purification and digestion, and delivers peptides that can be directly analyzed by LCMS, thereby significantly reducing hands-on time, reducing variability in protein quantification, and improving longitudinal reproducibility. We demonstrate the distinguishing ability of autoSP3 to process low-input samples, reproducibly quantifying 500-1,000 proteins from 100 to 1,000 cells. Furthermore, we applied this approach to a cohort of clinical FFPE pulmonary adenocarcinoma (ADC) samples and recapitulated their separation into known histological growth patterns. Finally, we integrated autoSP3 with AFA ultrasonication for the automated end-to-end sample preparation and LCMS analysis of 96 intact tissue samples. Collectively, this constitutes a generic, scalable, and cost-effective workflow with minimal manual intervention, enabling reproducible tissue proteomics in a broad range of clinical and non-clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) is based on the principle that, when subjected to heat, proteins denature and become insoluble. Proteins can change their thermal stability upon interactions with small molecules (such as drugs or metabolites), nucleic acids or other proteins, or upon post-translational modifications. TPP uses multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to monitor the melting profile of thousands of expressed proteins. Importantly, this approach can be performed in vitro, in situ, or in vivo. It has been successfully applied to identify targets and off-targets of drugs, or to study protein-metabolite and protein-protein interactions. Therefore, TPP provides a unique insight into protein state and interactions in their native context and at a proteome-wide level, allowing to study basic biological processes and their underlying mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics is becoming an essential methodology for the study of global cellular signaling. Numerous bioinformatics resources are available to facilitate the translation of phosphopeptide identification and quantification results into novel biological and clinical insights, a critical step in phosphoproteomics data analysis. These resources include knowledge bases of kinases and phosphatases, phosphorylation sites, kinase inhibitors, and sequence variants affecting kinase function, and bioinformatics tools that can predict phosphorylation sites in addition to the kinase that phosphorylates them, infer kinase activity, and predict the effect of mutations on kinase signaling. However, these resources exist in silos and it is challenging to select among multiple resources with similar functions. Therefore, we put together a comprehensive collection of resources related to phosphoproteomics data interpretation, compared the use of tools with similar functions, and assessed the usability from the standpoint of typical biologists or clinicians. Overall, tools could be improved by standardization of enzyme names, flexibility of data input and output format, consistent maintenance, and detailed manuals.",

    "abstract": "For the last century we have relied on model organisms to help understand fundamental biological processes. Now, with advancements in genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation, non-model organisms may be studied with the same advanced bioanalytical toolkit as model organisms. Proteomics is one such technique, which classically relies on predicted protein sequences to catalog and measure complex proteomes across tissues and biofluids. Applying proteomics to non-model organisms can advance and accelerate biomimicry studies, biomedical advancements, veterinary medicine, agricultural research, behavioral ecology, and food safety. In this postmodel organism era, we can study almost any species, meaning that many non-model organisms are, in fact, important emerging model organisms. Herein we specifically focus on eukaryotic organisms and discuss the steps to generate sequence databases, analyze proteomic data with or without a database, and interpret results as well as future research opportunities. Proteomics is more accessible than ever before and will continue to rapidly advance in the coming years, enabling critical research and discoveries in non-model organisms that were hitherto impossible.",

    "abstract": "Comparing multiple label-free shotgun proteomics datasets requires various data processing and formatting steps, including peptide-spectrum matching, protein inference, and quantification. Finally, the compilation of results files into a format that allows for downstream analyses. ProtyQuant performs protein inference and quantification calculations, and combines the results of individual datasets into plain text tables. These are lightweight, human-readable, and easy to import into databases or statistical software. ProtyQuant reads validated pepXML from proteomic workflows such as the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP), which makes it compatible with many commercial and free search engines. For protein inference and quantification, a modified version of the PIPQ program (He et al. 2016) was integrated. In contrast to simple spectral-counting, PIPQ sums up peptide probabilities. For assigning peptides to proteins, three algorithms are available: Multiple Counting, Equal Division, and Linear Programming. The accumulated peptide probabilities (app) are used for both tasks, protein probability estimation, and quantification. ProtyQuant was tested using a reference dataset for label-free shotgun proteomics, obtained from different concentrations of 48 human UPS proteins spiked into yeast lysate. Compared to ProteinProphet, ProtyQuant detected up to 126 (15%) more proteins in the mixture, applying an equal false positive rate (FPR). Using the app values for label-free quantification showed suitable sensitivity and linearity. Strikingly, the app values represent a realistic measure of 'Protein Presence,' an integral concept of protein probability and quantity. ProtyQuant provides a graphical user interface (GUI) and scripts for console-based processing. It is available (GNU GLP v3) for Windows, Linux, and Docker from https://bitbucket.org/lababi/protyquant/. SIGNIFICANCE: Integrating data from multiple shot-gun proteomics experiments overwhelms non-expert researchers. ProtyQuant complements well-established workflows by aiding the comparison of proteins across samples. Importantly, the probability and abundance of proteins are seen from a holistic point of view. The accumulated peptide probability (app) as an integral measure of 'Protein Presence' demonstrated reliable performance for both protein identification and quantification. Using the app as a single measure facilitates the compilation of reports in comparative proteomics.",

    "abstract": "Uncovering cellular responses from heterogeneous genomic data is crucial for molecular medicine in particular for drug safety. This can be realized by integrating the molecular activities in networks of interacting proteins. As proof-of-concept we challenge network modeling with time-resolved proteome, transcriptome and methylome measurements in iPSC-derived human 3D cardiac microtissues to elucidate adverse mechanisms of anthracycline cardiotoxicity measured with four different drugs (doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin and daunorubicin). Dynamic molecular analysis at in vivo drug exposure levels reveal a network of 175 disease-associated proteins and identify common modules of anthracycline cardiotoxicity in vitro, related to mitochondrial and sarcomere function as well as remodeling of extracellular matrix. These in vitro-identified modules are transferable and are evaluated with biopsies of cardiomyopathy patients. This to our knowledge most comprehensive study on anthracycline cardiotoxicity demonstrates a reproducible workflow for molecular medicine and serves as a template for detecting adverse drug responses from complex omics data.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides an architectural meshwork that surrounds and supports cells. The dysregulation of heavily post-translationally modified ECM proteins directly contributes to various diseases. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is an ideal tool to identify ECM proteins and characterize their post-translational modifications, but ECM proteomics remains challenging owing to the extremely low solubility of the ECM. Herein, enabled by effective solubilization of ECM proteins using our recently developed photocleavable surfactant, Azo, we have developed a streamlined ECM proteomic strategy that allows fast tissue decellularization, efficient extraction and enrichment of ECM proteins, and rapid digestion prior to reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC)-MS analysis. A total of 173 and 225 unique ECM proteins from mouse mammary tumors have been identified using 1D and 2D RPLC-MS/MS, respectively. Moreover, 87 (from 1DLC-MS/MS) and 229 (from 2DLC-MS/MS) post-translational modifications of ECM proteins, including glycosylation, phosphorylation, and hydroxylation, were identified and localized. This Azo-enabled ECM proteomics strategy will streamline the analysis of ECM proteins and promote the study of ECM biology.",

    "abstract": "Cellular life depends on a complex web of functional associations between biomolecules. Among these associations, protein-protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data. The STRING resource is available online, at https://string-db.org/.",

    "abstract": "The Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) provides the most comprehensive resource currently available for computable knowledge regarding the functions of genes and gene products. Here, we report the advances of the consortium over the past two years. The new GO-CAM annotation framework was notably improved, and we formalized the model with a computational schema to check and validate the rapidly increasing repository of 2838 GO-CAMs. In addition, we describe the impacts of several collaborations to refine GO and report a 10% increase in the number of GO annotations, a 25% increase in annotated gene products, and over 9,400 new scientific articles annotated. As the project matures, we continue our efforts to review older annotations in light of newer findings, and, to maintain consistency with other ontologies. As a result, 20 000 annotations derived from experimental data were reviewed, corresponding to 2.5% of experimental GO annotations. The website (http://geneontology.org) was redesigned for quick access to documentation, downloads and tools. To maintain an accurate resource and support traceability and reproducibility, we have made available a historical archive covering the past 15 years of GO data with a consistent format and file structure for both the ontology and annotations.",

    "abstract": "Shotgun proteomics techniques infer the presence and quantity of proteins using peptide proxies produced by cleavage of the proteome with a protease. Most protein quantitation strategies assume that multiple peptides derived from a protein will behave quantitatively similar across treatment groups, but this assumption may be false due to (1) heterogeneous proteoforms and (2) technical artifacts. Here we describe a strategy called peptide correlation analysis (PeCorA) that detects quantitative disagreements between peptides mapped to the same protein. PeCorA fits linear models to assess whether a peptide's change across treatment groups differs from all other peptides assigned to the same protein. PeCorA revealed that ∼15% of proteins in a mouse microglia stress data set contain at least one discordant peptide. Inspection of the discordant peptides shows the utility of PeCorA for the direct and indirect detection of regulated post-translational modifications (PTMs) and also for the discovery of poorly quantified peptides. The exclusion of poorly quantified peptides before protein quantity summarization decreased false-positives in a benchmark data set. Finally, PeCorA suggests that the inactive isoform of prothrombin, a coagulation cascade protease, is more abundant in plasma from COVID-19 patients relative to non-COVID-19 controls. PeCorA is freely available as an R package that works with arbitrary tables of quantified peptides.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS) is routinely used to identify, characterize, and quantify biological molecules. For protein analysis, MS-based workflows can be broadly categorized as top-down or bottom-up, depending on whether the proteins are analyzed as intact molecules or first digested into peptides. This article outlines steps for preparing peptide samples for MS as part of a bottom-up proteomics workflow, providing versatile methods suitable for discovery and targeted analyses in qualitative and quantitative workflows. Resulting samples contain peptides of suitable size for analysis by MS instrumentation generally available to modern research laboratories, including MS coupled to either liquid chromatography (LC) or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) interfaces. This article incorporates recent developments in methodologies and consumables to facilitate sample preparation. The protocols are well-suited to users without prior experience in proteomics and include methods for universally applicable suspension trap processing and for alternate in-solution processing to accommodate a range of sample types.

There are more than 400 different types of PTMs affecting many aspects of protein functions. Such modifications happen as crucial molecular regulatory mechanisms to regulate diverse cellular processes. These processes have a significant impact on the structure and function of proteins. Disruption in PTMs can lead to the dysfunction of vital biological processes and hence to various diseases. High-throughput experimental methods for discovery of PTMs are very laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need for computational methods and powerful tools to predict PTMs. There are vast amounts of PTMs data, which are publicly accessible through many online databases. In this survey, we comprehensively reviewed the major online databases and related tools. The current challenges of computational methods were reviewed in detail as well.",

    "abstract": "Lyophilization is a cost-effective method for biological specimen preservation but detailed tissue-specific reference protocols are still lacking. Moreover, data are limited on the long-term stability of proteins and nucleic acids in lyophilized samples.Here, we offer lyophilization protocols for various rat and mouse tissues (kidney, heart, liver, lung, aorta, and skin) coupled with technical hints for optimal sample preparation. We demonstrate that lyophilized samples stored at 4 °C for 20 months can yield protein and RNA of similar quantity and quality to -80 °C storage, while phosphorylated proteins are preserved as well. Freeze-dried and subsequently pulverized samples can provide more consistent, more reliable data especially when investigating focal injuries, such as fibrosis. We developed a protocol for the concentration of biological solutions and achieved 20-times concentration in human peritoneal dialysis effluent solution which enables the previously unattainable detection of proteins in these samples. We established a method for water removal as well as accurate water content measurement of fecal samples, which can be valuable for gut metabolome analysis.Taken together, lyophilization is a valuable tool for the preservation of biological samples with many advantages. We aim to draw attention to the wide range of possibilities offered by freeze drying in pre-clinical or basic research.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions are fundamental to various aspects of cell biology with many protein complexes participating in numerous fundamental biological processes such as transcription, translation and cell cycle. MS-based proteomics techniques are routinely applied for characterising the interactome, such as affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry that has been used to selectively enrich and identify interacting partners of a bait protein. In recent years, many orthogonal MS-based techniques and approaches have surfaced including proximity-dependent labelling of neighbouring proteins, chemical cross-linking of two interacting proteins, as well as inferring PPIs from the co-behaviour of proteins such as the co-fractionating profiles and the thermal solubility profiles of proteins. This review discusses the underlying principles, advantages, limitations and experimental considerations of these emerging techniques. In addition, a brief account on how MS-based techniques are used to investigate the structural and functional properties of protein complexes, including their topology, stoichiometry, copy number and dynamics, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The standard proteomics database search strategy involves searching spectra against a peptide database and estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) of the resulting set of peptide-spectrum matches. One assumption of this protocol is that all the peptides in the database are relevant to the hypothesis being investigated. However, in settings where researchers are interested in a subset of peptides, alternative search and FDR control strategies are needed. Recently, two methods were proposed to address this problem: subset-search and all-sub. We show that both methods fail to control the FDR. For subset-search, this failure is due to the presence of \"neighbor\" peptides, which are defined as irrelevant peptides with a similar precursor mass and fragmentation spectrum as a relevant peptide. Not considering neighbors compromises the FDR estimate because a spectrum generated by an irrelevant peptide can incorrectly match well to a relevant peptide. Therefore, we have developed a new method, \"subset-neighbor search\" (SNS), that accounts for neighbor peptides. We show evidence that SNS controls the FDR when neighbors are present and that SNS outperforms group-FDR, the only other method that appears to control the FDR relative to a subset of relevant peptides.",

    "abstract": "DeepMind presented notably accurate predictions at the recent 14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14) conference. We explored network architectures that incorporate related ideas and obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the one-dimensional (1D) sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the UV-vis spectra-activated droplet sorter (UVADS) for high-throughput label-free chemical identification and enzyme screening. In contrast to previous absorbance-based droplet sorters that relied on single-wavelength absorbance in the visible range, our platform collects full UV-vis spectra from 200 to 1050 nm at up to 2100 spectra per second. Our custom-built open-source software application, \"SpectraSorter,\" enables real-time data processing, analysis, visualization, and selection of droplets for sorting with any set of UV-vis spectral features. An optimized UV-vis detection region extended the absorbance path length for droplets and allowed for the direct protein quantification down to 10 μM of bovine serum albumin at 280 nm. UV-vis spectral data can distinguish a variety of different chemicals or spurious events (such as air bubbles) that are inaccessible at a single wavelength. The platform is used to measure ergothionase enzyme activity from monoclonal microcolonies isolated in droplets. In a label-free manner, we directly measure the ergothioneine substrate to thiourocanic acid product conversion while tracking the microcolony formation. UVADS represents an important new tool for high-throughput label-free in-droplet chemical analysis.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies against posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such as lysine acetylation, ubiquitin remnants, or phosphotyrosine have resulted in significant advances in our understanding of the fundamental roles of these PTMs in biology. However, the roles of a number of PTMs remain largely unexplored due to the lack of robust enrichment reagents. The addition of N-acetylglucosamine to serine and threonine residues (O-GlcNAc) by the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is a PTM implicated in numerous biological processes and disease states but with limited techniques for its study. Here, we evaluate a new mixture of anti-O-GlcNAc monoclonal antibodies for the immunoprecipitation of native O-GlcNAcylated peptides from cells and tissues. The anti-O-GlcNAc antibodies display good sensitivity and high specificity toward O-GlcNAc-modified peptides and do not recognize O-GalNAc or GlcNAc in extended glycans. Applying this antibody-based enrichment strategy to synaptosomes from mouse brain tissue samples, we identified over 1300 unique O-GlcNAc-modified peptides and over 1000 sites using just a fraction of sample preparation and instrument time required in other landmark investigations of O-GlcNAcylation. Our rapid and robust method greatly simplifies the analysis of O-GlcNAc signaling and will help to elucidate the role of this challenging PTM in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "The Reactome Knowledgebase (https://reactome.org), an Elixir core resource, provides manually curated molecular details across a broad range of physiological and pathological biological processes in humans, including both hereditary and acquired disease processes. The processes are annotated as an ordered network of molecular transformations in a single consistent data model. Reactome thus functions both as a digital archive of manually curated human biological processes and as a tool for discovering functional relationships in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic mutation catalogs from tumor cells. Recent curation work has expanded our annotations of normal and disease-associated signaling processes and of the drugs that target them, in particular infections caused by the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses and the host response to infection. New tools support better simultaneous analysis of high-throughput data from multiple sources and the placement of understudied ('dark') proteins from analyzed datasets in the context of Reactome's manually curated pathways.",

It is one of the essential mediators of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Aberrant IL-33 signaling has been demonstrated to play a defensive role against various infectious and inflammatory diseases. Although the signaling responses mediated by IL-33 have been previously reported, the temporal signaling dynamics are yet to be explored. To this end, we applied quantitative temporal phosphoproteomics analysis to elucidate pathways and proteins induced by IL-33 in THP-1 monocytes.

    "abstract": "Drugs are often metabolized to reactive intermediates that form protein adducts. Adducts can inhibit protein activity, elicit immune responses, and cause life-threatening adverse drug reactions. The masses of reactive metabolites are frequently unknown, rendering traditional mass spectrometry-based proteomics approaches incapable of adduct identification. Here, we present Magnum, an open-mass search algorithm optimized for adduct identification, and Limelight, a web-based data processing package for analysis and visualization of data from all existing algorithms. Limelight incorporates tools for sample comparisons and xenobiotic-adduct discovery. We validate our tools with three drug/protein combinations and apply our label-free workflow to identify novel xenobiotic-protein adducts in CYP3A4. Our new methods and software enable accurate identification of xenobiotic-protein adducts with no prior knowledge of adduct masses or protein targets. Magnum outperforms existing label-free tools in xenobiotic-protein adduct discovery, while Limelight fulfills a major need in the rapidly developing field of open-mass searching, which until now lacked comprehensive data visualization tools.",

Nowadays, mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics is a well-established method providing unprecedented characterization and quantification of phosphorylated proteins and peptides in complex samples. A comprehensive phosphoproteomics workflow consists of protein digestion, phosphopeptide enrichment, sample fractionation, chromatographic separation, and final detection by mass spectrometry. Each of these stages provides its own contribution to overall data variability and should be optimized thoroughly. This review aims to provide an overview of current developments in individual steps of phosphoproteomics workflow with a special focus on applied analytical methods. Recent efforts in all experimental steps are discussed. Finally, possible future development in the field of (phospho)proteomics is proposed.",

    "abstract": "Gene set enrichment tests (a.k.a. functional enrichment analysis) are among the most frequently used methods in computational biology. Despite this popularity, there are concerns that these methods are being applied incorrectly and the results of some peer-reviewed publications are unreliable. These problems include the use of inappropriate background gene lists, lack of false discovery rate correction and lack of methodological detail. To ascertain the frequency of these issues in the literature, we performed a screen of 186 open-access research articles describing functional enrichment results. We find that 95% of analyses using over-representation tests did not implement an appropriate background gene list or did not describe this in the methods. Failure to perform p-value correction for multiple tests was identified in 43% of analyses. Many studies lacked detail in the methods section about the tools and gene sets used. An extension of this survey showed that these problems are not associated with journal or article level bibliometrics. Using seven independent RNA-seq datasets, we show misuse of enrichment tools alters results substantially. In conclusion, most published functional enrichment studies suffered from one or more major flaws, highlighting the need for stronger standards for enrichment analysis.",

    "abstract": "O-linked β-D-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is an important post-translational modification of serine or threonine residues on thousands of proteins in the nucleus and cytoplasm of all animals and plants. In eukaryotes, only two conserved enzymes are involved in this process. O-GlcNAc transferase is responsible for adding O-GlcNAc to proteins, while O-GlcNAcase is responsible for removing it. Aberrant O-GlcNAcylation is associated with a variety of human diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Numerous studies have confirmed that O-GlcNAcylation is involved in the occurrence and progression of cancers in multiple systems throughout the body. It is also involved in regulating multiple cancer hallmarks, such as metabolic reprogramming, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. In this review, we first describe the process of O-GlcNAcylation and the structure and function of O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes. In addition, we detail the occurrence of O-GlcNAc in various cancers and the role it plays. Finally, we discuss the potential of O-GlcNAc as a promising biomarker and novel therapeutic target for cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.",

    "abstract": "The 2022 Metrics of the Human Proteome from the HUPO Human Proteome Project (HPP) show that protein expression has now been credibly detected (neXtProt PE1 level) for 18 407 (93.2%) of the 19 750 predicted proteins coded in the human genome, a net gain of 50 since 2021 from data sets generated around the world and reanalyzed by the HPP. Conversely, the number of neXtProt PE2, PE3, and PE4 missing proteins has been reduced by 78 from 1421 to 1343. This represents continuing experimental progress on the human proteome parts list across all the chromosomes, as well as significant reclassifications. Meanwhile, applying proteomics in a vast array of biological and clinical studies continues to yield significant findings and growing integration with other omics platforms. We present highlights from the Chromosome-Centric HPP, Biology and Disease-driven HPP, and HPP Resource Pillars, compare features of mass spectrometry and Olink and Somalogic platforms, note the emergence of translation products from ribosome profiling of small open reading frames, and discuss the launch of the initial HPP Grand Challenge Project, \"A Function for Each Protein\".",

    "abstract": "Biological networks are often used to represent complex biological systems, which can contain several types of entities. Analysis and visualization of such networks is supported by the Cytoscape software tool and its many apps. While earlier versions of stringApp focused on providing intraspecies protein-protein interactions from the STRING database, the new stringApp 2.0 greatly improves the support for heterogeneous networks. Here, we highlight new functionality that makes it possible to create networks that contain proteins and interactions from STRING as well as other biological entities and associations from other sources. We exemplify this by complementing a published SARS-CoV-2 interactome with interactions from STRING. We have also extended stringApp with new data and query functionality for protein-protein interactions between eukaryotic parasites and their hosts. We show how this can be used to retrieve and visualize a cross-species network for a malaria parasite, its host, and its vector. Finally, the latest stringApp version has an improved user interface, allows retrieval of both functional associations and physical interactions, and supports group-wise enrichment analysis of different parts of a network to aid biological interpretation. stringApp is freely available at https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/stringapp.",

Many of the tools include machine-learning modeling to extract the most information from data sets and build robust statistical models to compute the probabilities that derived information is correct. Here we present the latest information on the many TPP tools, and how TPP can be deployed on various platforms from personal Windows laptops to Linux clusters and expansive cloud computing environments. We describe tutorials on how to use TPP in a variety of ways and describe synergistic projects that leverage TPP. We conclude with plans for continued development of TPP.",

    "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common head and neck malignancy, with an estimated 5-year survival rate of only 40-50%, largely due to late detection and diagnosis. Emerging evidence suggests that the human microbiome may be implicated in OSCC, with oral microbiome studies putatively identifying relevant bacterial species. As the impact of other microbial organisms, such as fungi and viruses, has largely been neglected, a bioinformatic approach utilizing the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) and the R statistical programming language was implemented here to investigate not only bacteria, but also viruses and fungi in the context of a publicly available, OSCC, mass spectrometry (MS) dataset. Overall viral, bacterial, and fungal composition was inferred in control and OSCC patient tissue from protein data, with a range of proteins observed to be differentially enriched between healthy and OSCC conditions, of which the fungal protein profile presented as the best potential discriminator of OSCC within the analysed dataset. While the current project sheds new light on the fungal and viral spheres of the oral microbiome in cancer in silico, further research will be required to validate these findings in an experimental setting.",

    "abstract": "The identification of thousands of proteins and their relative levels of expression has furthered understanding of biological processes and disease and stimulated new systems biology hypotheses. Quantitative proteomics workflows that rely on analytical assays such as mass spectrometry have facilitated high-throughput measurements of proteins partially due to multiplexing. Multiplexing allows proteome differences across multiple samples to be measured simultaneously, resulting in more accurate quantitation, increased statistical robustness, reduced analysis times, and lower experimental costs. The number of samples that can be multiplexed has evolved from as few as two to more than 50, with studies involving more than 10 samples being denoted as enhanced multiplexing or hyperplexing. In this review, we give an update on emerging multiplexing proteomics techniques and highlight advantages and limitations for enhanced multiplexing strategies.",

    "abstract": "Bicinchoninic acid, sodium salt, is a stable, water-soluble compound capable of forming an intense purple complex with cuprous ion (Cu1+) in an alkaline environment. This reagent forms the basis of an analytical method capable of monitoring cuprous ion produced in the reaction of protein with alkaline Cu2+ (biuret reaction). The color produced from this reaction is stable and increases in a proportional fashion over a broad range of increasing protein concentrations. When compared to the method of Lowry et al., the results reported here demonstrate a greater tolerance of the bicinchoninate reagent toward such commonly encountered interferences as nonionic detergents and simple buffer salts. The stability of the reagent and resulting chromophore also allows for a simplified, one-step analysis and an enhanced flexibility in protocol selection. This new method maintains the high sensitivity and low protein-to-protein variation associated with the Lowry technique.",

    "abstract": "A reliable and reproducible method for the estimation of the protein content of fungal cells immobilized in a carrageenan gel is described. The procedure depends upon the acid lability of the polysaccharide gel at 90 degrees C and on the acetone solubility of accumulated phenolics. Freeze-dried gel beads (2-3 mm) containing entrapped cells of Penicillium urticae were ground to a fine powder and samples of powder (approximately 20 mg) were sequentially extracted with hot 1 N HCl - 0.9% NaCl and acetone. The precipitated residue contained the cell protein, which was then solubilized with 1 N NaOH at 90 degrees C and quantitated by the Folin-Lowry method. Interferences from both carrageenan and phenols were thus eliminated. The presence of carrageenan (20-25 mg) did not affect the recovery of varying amounts (0-2500 micrograms) of bovine serum albumin. The recovery of radiolabeled protein from immobilized cells was parallel to that of Folin-Lowry positive material over a range of 0-60 beads (0-60 mg powder). Cycloheximide (0-100 micrograms/mL) was shown to progressively inhibit the incorporation of L-[U-14C]leucine so that the radioactivity present in the initial HCl-NaCl extract (i.e., [14C]leucine) increased as that in the final NaOH extract (i.e., 14C-labeled protein) decreased. Using this new assay for cell protein, free and immobilized cell cultures were found to exhibit virtually identical kinetics of glucose utilization, growth, and patulin production. In addition to providing a means of comparing the specific productivity of free versus immobilized cell preparations, this assay accurately measures the incorporation of [14C]leucine into cellular protein and could be used as a measure of cell viability.",

The strategy was used to define the region of interaction of a protein growth factor with a monoclonal antibody. A combination of proteolytic digestion and affinity-directed mass spectrometry was used to rapidly determine the approximate location of a continuous binding epitope within the growth factor. The precise boundaries of the binding epitope were determined by affinity-directed mass spectrometric analysis of sets of synthetic peptide ladders that span the approximate binding region. In addition to the mapping of such linear epitopes, affinity-directed mass spectrometry can be applied to the mapping of other types of molecule-molecule contacts, including ligand-receptor and protein-oligonucleotide interactions.",

The sensitivity and dynamic range of CBQCA in the determination of protein concentration is modulated by the number of accessible amines present in the protein assayed. Thus, this method bears the same limitations as other reagents used in fluorogenic assays based on fluorescent amine adducts such as those obtained with fluorescamine or o-phthaldialdehyde, or of other spectrophotometric methods, where the color development is determined by the abundance in the protein of certain amino acids. However, in comparison to other fluorescence-based protein detection methods, CBQCA has proven to be an extremely sensitive reagent with a very broad, essentially linear dynamic range, capable of detecting from 10 ng to 150 micrograms of protein (in a 100- to 200-microL assay volume). The CBQCA reagent also functions well in the presence of substances, such as lipids, known to interfere in many other protein determination methods.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms of band broadening in linear, nonideal chromatography are examined. A development is presented of a rate theory for this process, wherein nonideality is caused by: •axial molecular diffusion ;•axial eddy diffusion ;•finiteness of transfer coefficient. The correspondence with the plate theory is given, so that the results can also be expressed in heights equivalent to a theoretical plate. The plate theory has been extended to the case of a finite volume of feed ; the requirement for this feed volume to be negligible has been examined and a method is presented for evaluating concentration profiles obtained with a larger volume of feed. An analysis is given of experimental results, whereby the relative contributions to band broadening for various cooperating mechanisms could be ascertained.\nRésumé\nUne étude a été faite des mécanismes de l'élargissement des bandes dans la chromatographie linéaire non-idéale. On a développé une théorie sur la vitesse de ce processus, selon laquelle la non-idéalité est causée par : •la diffusion moléculaire axiale ;•la diffusion turbulente axiale ;•le fait que le coefficient de transfert a une valeur finie. La correspondance établie entre cette théorie et celle des plateaux permet d'exprimer les résultats obtenus aussi en termes de la hauteur de colonne équivalente à un étage théorique. La théorie des plateaux a été rendue applicable sur le cas d'un échantillon de volume fini ; les conditions dans lesquelles le volume de cet échantillon est négligeable ont été étudiées et on présente une méthode pour interpréter les profiles de concentration obtenus avec des échantillons plus grands. Une analyse des résultats expérimentaux a permis de déterminer les contributions relatives des différents mécanismes en question à l'élargissement des bandes.",

For a given signal-to-noise ratio and resolution, the FT-ICR method generates a spectrum in a time which is two orders of magnitude shorter than that required in conventional slow-sweep ICR detection. In the present example, a signal-to-noise ratio of 8:1 and a mass resolution of about 0.005 amu for CH4+ (from CH4 at a pressure of 8 X 10−7 torr) have been achieved, using a single data acquisition period of 25.6 msec.",

    "abstract": "Beside the known maximum of electron capture dissociation (ECD) of gas-phase polypeptide polycations at zero electron energy, a broad local maximum is found around 10 eV. This maximum is due to electronic excitation prior to electron capture, as in dissociative recombination of small cations. In the novel hot electron capture dissociation (HECD) regime, not only N–Cα bonds are cleaved as in ECD, but secondary fragmentation is also induced due to the excess energy. Beneficially, this fragmentation includes abundant losses of CH(CH3)2 from leucine and CH2CH3 from isoleucine residues terminal to the cleavage site, which allows for distinguishing between these two isomeric residues.",
